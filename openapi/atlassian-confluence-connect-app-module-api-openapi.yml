  title: Atlassian Confluence Connect App Module API
  description: >-
    The Atlassian Confluence Connect App Module API is a powerful tool that
    allows developers to create custom functionalities and integrations within
    the Confluence platform. With this API, developers can build apps that
    extend the capabilities of Confluence, such as adding new macro types,
    customizing editor behavior, and integrating with external services. The API
    provides a robust set of tools and resources, enabling developers to tailor
    their apps to meet specific business requirements and enhance collaboration
    and productivity within Confluence.

      description: >-
        The Get Modules API operation retrieves information about dynamically
        registered modules within an Atlassian Connect app. This endpoint allows
        developers to query and fetch details about modules that have been
        registered dynamically rather than statically defined in the app
        descriptor. By making a GET request to this endpoint, you can obtain a
        list of all dynamic modules currently registered for your Connect app,
        including their configurations, types, and metadata. This is
        particularly useful for managing and auditing modules that are added or
        modified at runtime, enabling developers to programmatically verify
        which modules are active and accessible within the Atlassian product
        integration.

      description: >-
        This API operation allows Atlassian Connect apps to dynamically register
        new modules with a Confluence instance at runtime, extending the app's
        functionality without requiring a full app descriptor update. By sending
        a POST request to the /atlassian-connect/1/app/module/dynamic endpoint,
        developers can add new web items, web panels, dialogs, or other
        supported module types on-the-fly, enabling more flexible and responsive
        app behavior based on user actions, configuration changes, or external
        events. The operation requires authentication via JWT and the module
        definitions must conform to the Atlassian Connect module schema, with
        the registered modules persisting until explicitly removed or the app is
        uninstalled.

      summary: Remove Modules
      description: >-
        This API operation allows developers to remove dynamically registered
        modules from an Atlassian Confluence Connect app. When called via DELETE
        request to the /atlassian-connect/1/app/module/dynamic endpoint, it
        removes previously added modules that were registered at runtime rather
        than being defined in the app descriptor. This is particularly useful
        for Connect apps that need to programmatically manage their module
        lifecycle, enabling them to clean up or deregister modules that are no
        longer needed without requiring a full app reinstallation or descriptor
        update. The operation requires proper authentication and authorization,
        and successfully removing a module will make it unavailable in the
        Confluence interface until it is registered again through the dynamic
        module registration API.

    - title: About
      anchor: about
      body: >-
        This is the reference for the Confluence Cloud REST API. This API is the
        primary way to get and

        modify data in Confluence Cloud, whether you are developing an app or
        any other integration.

        Use it to interact with Confluence entities, like pages and blog posts,
        spaces, users, groups,

        and more.
    - title: Authentication and authorization
      anchor: auth
      body: >-
        **Authentication:** If you are building a Cloud app, authentication is
        implemented via JWT or OAuth 2.0, depending on what you are building
        (see [Security
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)).
        Otherwise, if you are authenticating directly against the REST API, the
        REST API supports basic auth (see [Basic auth for REST
        APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)).


        **Authorization:** If you are building a Cloud app, authorization can be
        implemented by
        [scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/scopes/) or by
        [OAuth 2.0 user
        impersonation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-jwt-bearer-tokens-for-apps).
        Otherwise, if you are making calls directly against the REST API,
        authorization is based on the user used in the authentication process.


        See [Security
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)
        for more details on authentication and authorization.
    - title: Status codes
      anchor: status-code
      body: >-
        The Confluence REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
        codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


        Responses that return an error status code will also return a response
        body, similar to the following:

        ```json

        {
          "statusCode": 404,
          "data": {
            "authorized": false,
            "valid": false,
            "errors": [
              {
                "message": {
                  "translation": "This is an example error message.",
                  "args": []
                }
              }
            ],
            "successful": false
          },
          "message": "This is an example error message."
        }

        ```
    - title: Using the REST API
      anchor: using
      body: >-
        **Expansion:** The Confluence REST API uses resource expansion: some
        parts of a resource are not returned unless explicitly specified. This
        simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.


        To expand part of a resource in a request, use the `expand` query
        parameter and specify the entities to be expanded. If you need to expand
        nested entities, use the `.` dot notation. For example, the following
        request will expand information about the requested content's space and
        labels:

        ```

        GET /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}?expand=space,metadata.labels

        ```

        **Pagination:** The Confluence REST API uses pagination: a method that
        returns a response with multiple objects can only return a limited
        number at one time. This limits the size of responses and conserves
        server resources.


        Use the 'limit' and 'start' query parameters to specify pagination:


        - `limit` is the number of objects to return per page. This may be
        restricted by system limits.

        - `start` is the index of the first item returned in the page of
        results. The base index is 0.


        For example, the following request will return ten content objects,
        starting from the fifth object.

        ```

        GET /wiki/rest/api/content?start=4&limit=10

        ```

        **Special headers:**


        - `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` request header must be specified for
        methods

        that are protected from Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF) attacks.
        This is

        stated in the method description, if required. For more information, see
        this

        [KB
        article](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/xsrf-check-failed-when-calling-cloud-apis-826874382.html).
    - title: Capabilities
      anchor: capabilities
      body: >-
        **Webhooks:** A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP. You can
        use Confluence webhooks to notify your app or web application when
        certain events occur in Confluence. For example, when a page is created
        or updated. To learn more, see
        [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/modules/webhook/).


        **Content properties:** Content properties are a key-value storage
        associated with a piece of Confluence content. If you are building an
        app, this is one form of persistence that you can use. You can use the
        Confluence REST API to get, update, and delete content properties. To
        learn more, see [Content properties in the REST
        API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/content-properties/).


        **CQL:** The Confluence Query Language (CQL) allows you to perform
        complex searches for content using an SQL-like syntax in the `search`
        resource. To learn more, see [Advanced searching using
        CQL](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/).

  title: Atlassian Bit Bucket Repositories API
  description: >-
    The Atlassian BitBucket Repositories API is a powerful tool that allows
    users to interact with and manage repositories in their BitBucket accounts
    programmatically. With this API, developers can create, update, and delete
    repositories, as well as access and manipulate repository metadata such as
    commit history, branches, and pull requests. Additionally, users can
    integrate the API with other tools and services to automate various tasks,
    streamline workflows, and improve collaboration within their development
    teams. Overall, the BitBucket Repositories API provides a flexible and
    efficient way to manage repositories and leverage the full potential of the
    BitBucket platform.

        This API operation retrieves a paginated list of all repositories within
        a specified Bitbucket workspace. By making a GET request to the
        /repositories/{workspace} endpoint, users can access comprehensive
        information about repositories that belong to a particular workspace,
        where the workspace parameter in the URL path identifies the target
        workspace by its slug or UUID. The response includes repository metadata
        such as names, descriptions, creation dates, visibility settings (public
        or private), and associated project information. This endpoint supports
        various query parameters for filtering, sorting, and pagination,
        allowing developers to efficiently browse through large collections of
        repositories and integrate repository listings into their applications
        or workflows. Authentication is required to access private repositories,
        and the results respect the user's access permissions within the
        workspace.

        The Delete Repository operation in the Atlassian Bitbucket Repositories
        API allows you to permanently remove a repository from a workspace by
        sending a DELETE request to the `/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}`
        endpoint. This operation requires you to specify both the workspace
        identifier and the repository slug in the URL path. Once executed, the
        repository and all its associated data, including source code, branches,
        commits, and pull requests, will be irreversibly deleted from Bitbucket.
        This is a destructive action that typically requires appropriate
        permissions, such as administrator access to the repository, and should
        be used with caution as it cannot be undone.

        This API operation creates a new repository within a specified workspace
        in Atlassian Bitbucket. By sending a POST request to the endpoint with
        the workspace identifier and desired repository slug as path parameters,
        users can programmatically initialize a new repository with configurable
        settings such as project assignment, description, privacy settings

        the request body. The operation returns the newly created repository
        object including its UUID, full name, creation timestamp, and links to
        related resources, making it essential for automated repository
        provisioning and DevOps workflows that need to dynamically set up

      description: >-
        This API operation creates a new branch restriction rule for a specific
        repository in Bitbucket Cloud, allowing workspace administrators to
        enforce policies on branches within a given repository. By sending a
        POST request to the endpoint with the workspace ID and repository slug
        as path parameters, users can define restrictions such as preventing
        force pushes, requiring pull request approvals, limiting who can merge
        or push to specific branches, or enforcing other branch protection
        policies. The request body typically includes details like the
        restriction type, the branch pattern to which the rule applies (using
        glob patterns or specific branch names), and the users or groups
        affected by the restriction. This functionality is essential for
        maintaining code quality and implementing workflow controls in
        collaborative development environments, ensuring that critical branches
        like main or production are protected from unauthorized or potentially
        harmful changes.

        The Delete Branch Restriction Rule operation in the Atlassian Bitbucket
        Repositories API allows you to remove a specific branch restriction rule
        from a repository by making a DELETE request to the endpoint
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/branch-restrictions/{id}. This
        operation requires you to specify the workspace name, repository slug,
        and the unique identifier of the branch restriction rule you want to
        delete. Branch restrictions are used to enforce policies on branches,
        such as preventing direct pushes, requiring pull requests, or limiting
        who can merge changes. By deleting a branch restriction rule, you
        effectively remove those constraints from the specified branches in your
        repository. This operation is useful when you need to modify your
        repository's branch protection strategy, remove outdated restrictions,
        or adjust team workflows. Authentication and appropriate permissions are
        required to execute this operation successfully, as it affects
        repository security and collaboration policies.

        in the Atlassian Bitbucket Repositories API retrieves detailed
        information about a specific branch restriction rule within a
        repository. By providing the workspace identifier, repository slug, and
        the unique ID of the branch restriction, this operation returns the
        complete configuration of that particular rule, including its type (such
        as requiring pull request approvals, restricting pushes, or enforcing
        merge checks), the branch pattern it applies to, the users or groups it
        affects, and any associated permissions or conditions. This endpoint is
        useful for administrators and developers who need to audit existing
        branch protection settings, verify security policies, or
        programmatically inspect repository governance rules before making
        modifications.

        This API operation allows you to modify an existing branch restriction
        rule in a Bitbucket repository by specifying the workspace, repository
        slug, and the unique identifier of the restriction rule you want to
        update. The PUT request enables you to change the configuration of
        access controls and permissions that govern who can push, merge, or
        perform other operations on specific branches within the repository. You
        can adjust parameters such as the branch pattern the rule applies to,
        the type of restriction (like requiring pull requests or limiting direct
        pushes), and which users or groups are affected by or exempt from the
        rule. This is particularly useful for maintaining code quality and
        enforcing workflow policies as your team's requirements evolve, allowing
        administrators to refine branch protection rules without having to
        delete and recreate them from scratch.

        This API operation removes an approval from a specific commit in a
        Bitbucket repository by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint. When a
        user has previously approved a commit, this operation revokes that
        approval, effectively indicating that the commit no longer has their
        endorsement. The operation requires three path parameters: the workspace
        identifier, the repository slug, and the commit hash or reference. This
        is particularly useful in code review workflows where approvals may need
        to be withdrawn due to newly discovered issues, changes in requirements,
        or mistakes in the initial review, allowing teams to maintain accurate
        approval states throughout their development process.

        This API operation allows authenticated users to approve a specific
        commit in a Bitbucket repository by sending a POST request to the
        endpoint with the workspace identifier, repository slug, and commit hash
        as path parameters. When executed, it records the user's approval of the
        changes introduced in that particular commit, which is useful for code
        review workflows and tracking which team members have endorsed specific
        changes. The approval is associated with the authenticated user making
        the request and can be used as part of merge requirements or quality
        gates in the development process. This operation is idempotent, meaning
        multiple calls with the same parameters will have the same effect as a
        single call, and it returns information about the approval that was
        created or already exists.

      summary: Update Commit Application Property
      description: >-
        This API operation allows you to update or set an application-specific
        property for a particular commit within a Bitbucket repository. By
        making a PUT request to this endpoint, you specify the workspace,
        repository slug, commit hash, application key, and property name to
        target a specific property associated with that commit. This is useful
        for storing custom metadata or application-specific information linked
        to a commit, such as build status, deployment information, or any other
        contextual data your application needs to maintain. The operation will
        create the property if it doesn't exist or update it if it already does,
        providing a way to persist and manage commit-level data that extends
        beyond Bitbucket's standard commit attributes.

      description: >-
        Removes a specific application property associated with a commit in a
        Bitbucket repository. This operation allows applications to delete
        custom metadata they previously stored against a particular commit,
        identified by the workspace, repository slug, commit hash, application
        key, and property name. Once deleted, the property and its associated
        value are permanently removed from the commit's application properties
        collection. This is useful for cleaning up outdated or no longer needed
        custom data that applications have attached to commits for tracking,
        automation, or integration purposes.

        that was previously set on that commit by a specific application. This
        allows applications to store and retrieve metadata or custom attributes
        tied to individual commits, enabling features like tracking deployment

        This PUT operation creates or updates a report for a specific commit in
        a Bitbucket repository, identified by the workspace, repository slug,

        additional build, test, or code quality information about a commit, such
        as code coverage, security scans, or custom analysis results. The
        operation requires authentication and appropriate permissions to the
        repository, and accepts a JSON payload containing the report details
        including its title, reporter, result status (PASSED, FAILED, or
        PENDING), and optional metadata like links and data fields. If a report
        with the specified ID already exists for the commit, it will be updated;
        otherwise, a new report will be created. This endpoint is commonly used
        by CI/CD tools and third-party integrations to display supplementary
        commit status information directly within the Bitbucket interface,

        sending a DELETE request to this endpoint with the workspace identifier,
        repository slug, commit hash, and report ID, you can permanently delete
        the associated report and all its data, including any annotations or

        retrieve all annotations that were added to a particular report, which
        typically includes details about code quality issues, security

        This POST endpoint creates a build status for a specific commit in a
        Bitbucket repository, allowing external CI/CD systems and build tools to
        report the status of automated builds back to Bitbucket. The endpoint
        requires the workspace ID, repository slug, and commit hash as path
        parameters, and accepts a JSON payload containing build status
        information such as state (successful, failed, in progress), key, name,
        URL, and description. When invoked, it associates the provided build
        status with the specified commit, which then becomes visible in the
        Bitbucket UI on pull requests and commit pages, enabling teams to track
        build results and prevent merging of code that fails automated checks.
        This integration is essential for maintaining CI/CD pipelines and
        ensuring code quality by providing real-time feedback on build outcomes
        directly within the version control interface.

        you to query the detailed status information of a particular build or
        CI/CD pipeline execution that was reported for a given commit. You must
        provide the workspace identifier, repository slug, commit hash, and the
        unique key of the build status you want to retrieve. The response
        includes comprehensive details about the build execution such as its

        This API operation updates the build status for a specific commit in a
        Bitbucket repository by making a PUT request to the endpoint that
        identifies a unique build status entry through the workspace name,
        repository slug, commit hash, and a unique key identifier. It allows
        developers and CI/CD systems to modify the state of an existing build
        status record associated with a particular commit, enabling them to
        update information such as whether the build is in progress, successful,
        failed, or stopped, along with relevant metadata like build URLs,
        descriptions, and timestamps. This is particularly useful for continuous
        integration workflows where build systems need to communicate the
        current state of automated builds and tests back to Bitbucket, providing
        visibility to team members about the health and status of code changes
        directly within the repository interface.

        retrieves a paginated list of commits from a specific repository by
        making a GET request to the endpoint
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits. This endpoint requires
        two path parameters: the workspace ID or slug that owns the repository,
        and the repo_slug which uniquely identifies the repository within that
        workspace. The response returns commit objects in reverse chronological
        order by default, with each commit containing metadata such as the
        commit hash, author information, timestamp, commit message, and parent
        commit references. Optional query parameters can be used to filter the
        results by branch, tag, or specific commit ranges, and to control
        pagination through the result set. This API operation is commonly used
        for displaying commit history, tracking changes, or integrating
        repository activity into external tools and dashboards.

        The Atlassian Bitbucket Repositories API endpoint
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits allows users to retrieve a
        paginated list of commits from a specific repository by making a POST
        request. This operation provides advanced filtering capabilities through
        include and exclude parameters, enabling developers to narrow down
        commits based on branches, tags, bookmarks, or specific commit hashes.
        Users can specify the workspace identifier and repository slug in the
        path parameters to target a particular repository, while the request
        body can contain arrays of references to include or exclude from the
        results. The response returns commit objects containing metadata such as
        commit hash, author information, commit message, timestamp, and parent
        references, making it useful for analyzing repository history,
        generating changelogs, or implementing custom git workflows that require
        filtered commit information.

        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/{revision}, you can access
        commit history starting from the specified revision, which can be a
        branch name, tag, or commit SHA. The endpoint returns commit details
        including author information, commit messages, timestamps, and parent
        commit references. The response is paginated to handle repositories with
        extensive commit histories, and you can use query parameters to control
        pagination and filter results. This operation is useful for tracking
        changes, auditing code history, or building integrations that need to
        analyze commit data for a particular branch or point in the repository's
        timeline.

        branches, tags, or other revisions. This is particularly useful for
        generating commit histories between specific points in the repository's
        history or for filtering out commits from certain branches while
        focusing on others. The response returns commit objects containing
        information such as commit hash, author, date, message, and parent
        commits in a paginated format.

        This API operation allows you to add a new deploy key to a specific
        Bitbucket repository within a workspace. Deploy keys are SSH keys that
        grant read-only or read-write access to a repository, typically used for
        automated deployment processes or CI/CD pipelines. By making a POST
        request to this endpoint with the workspace identifier and repository
        slug, along with the required key details in the request body (such as
        the SSH public key and an optional label), you can programmatically
        register a new deploy key that will enable secure, automated access to
        the repository without requiring user credentials.

        This API operation removes a specific deploy key from a Bitbucket
        repository by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint with the
        workspace identifier, repository slug, and deploy key ID as path
        parameters. Deploy keys are SSH keys that grant read-only or read-write
        access to a repository, typically used for automated deployment
        processes or CI/CD pipelines. When this operation is executed
        successfully, it permanently deletes the specified deploy key from the
        repository, revoking any access that was previously granted through that
        key. This is useful for security management, such as when rotating keys,
        removing access for deprecated deployment systems, or cleaning up unused
        authentication credentials. The operation requires appropriate
        permissions on the repository to manage deploy keys.

        This API operation retrieves detailed information about a specific
        deploy key that has been added to a Bitbucket repository. By providing
        the workspace identifier, repository slug, and the unique key ID, you
        can fetch the complete configuration and metadata associated with that
        particular SSH deploy key, including its label, the actual public key
        content, creation timestamp, and access permissions. Deploy keys are
        typically used to grant read-only or read-write access to repositories
        for automated deployment systems and CI/CD pipelines without requiring a
        user account, and this endpoint allows administrators to verify and
        audit the deploy keys currently configured for their repository.

        repository in Bitbucket by making a PUT request to the endpoint with the
        workspace ID, repository slug, and deploy key ID as path parameters.
        Deploy keys are SSH keys that provide read-only or read-write access to
        a single repository, commonly used for automated deployment processes or
        CI/CD pipelines. The operation allows you to modify properties of an
        existing deploy key such as its label, the actual key value, or access
        permissions, enabling administrators to maintain and update deployment
        credentials without having to delete and recreate them. Authentication
        is required to perform this operation, and the user must have
        administrative permissions on the repository to successfully update
        deploy key configurations.

        Updates an existing deployment environment variable for a specific
        environment in a Bitbucket repository. This operation requires
        specifying the workspace, repository slug, environment UUID, and
        variable UUID in the request path. The PUT method allows you to modify
        the variable's configuration such as its key, value, secured status, and
        other properties. This is useful for managing environment-specific
        configuration values like API keys, database connection strings, or
        feature flags that are used during the deployment pipeline. The request
        must include authentication credentials with appropriate permissions to
        modify deployment variables in the specified repository and environment.

        This API operation allows you to delete a specific deployment variable
        associated with an environment in a Bitbucket repository. By providing
        the workspace identifier, repository slug, environment UUID, and
        variable UUID in the request path, you can permanently remove a variable
        that was previously configured for deployment purposes. This is useful
        when cleaning up unused configuration variables or removing sensitive
        information that is no longer needed for your deployment pipeline. The
        deletion is performed via an HTTP DELETE request and requires
        appropriate authentication and permissions to modify deployment
        environment settings within the specified Bitbucket repository.

        This API operation retrieves the diff between two commits in a Bitbucket
        repository, allowing developers to see the changes made between
        specified points in the code history. By providing the workspace
        identifier, repository slug, and a spec parameter that defines the
        commits to compare (typically in the format of commit1..commit2 or a
        single commit reference), the endpoint returns detailed information
        about added, modified, and deleted lines across all affected files. The
        response includes unified diff format data that shows line-by-line
        changes, file paths, and metadata about the modifications, making it
        useful for code review processes, analyzing changes between branches or
        releases, and understanding the evolution of the codebase over time.

            like these, a 555 status code is returned.

        This API endpoint retrieves diff statistics comparing changes between
        two commits in a Bitbucket repository. By specifying the workspace,
        repository slug, and a spec parameter (which typically contains the
        commit range or comparison specification), it returns statistical
        information about the differences between the specified commits,
        including metrics such as the number of files changed, lines added, and
        lines removed. This is particularly useful for analyzing the scope and
        impact of changes between different points in a repository's history
        without retrieving the full diff content, making it more efficient for
        generating summaries or reports of code changes.

        The Delete Download Artifact operation in the Atlassian Bitbucket
        Repositories API allows users to remove a specific download artifact
        from a repository by making a DELETE request to the endpoint
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/downloads/{filename}. This
        operation requires three path parameters: the workspace identifier, the
        repository slug, and the exact filename of the artifact to be deleted.
        When executed successfully, it permanently removes the specified file
        from the repository's downloads section, which is typically used for
        storing release artifacts, binaries, or other distributable files
        associated with the repository. This operation is useful for managing
        repository storage, removing outdated releases, or cleaning up
        unnecessary files from the downloads area.

        The Atlassian Bitbucket Repositories API endpoint
        `/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/downloads/{filename}` using the
        GET method retrieves a redirect link to download a specific file
        artifact that has been uploaded to a repository's downloads section.
        This operation requires three path parameters: the workspace ID or slug
        that owns the repository, the repository slug identifier, and the exact
        filename of the download artifact you want to access. When called,
        instead of returning the file content directly, the API responds with a
        302 redirect to the actual download URL where the file is stored,
        allowing clients to fetch the artifact from Bitbucket's storage
        infrastructure. This is particularly useful for accessing release
        binaries, documentation archives, or other supplementary files
        associated with a repository that aren't part of the source code itself.

        This API operation retrieves the effective branching model currently
        applied to a specific Bitbucket repository within a given workspace. By
        providing the workspace identifier and repository slug as path
        parameters, it returns the active branching model configuration that
        governs how branches are organized and managed in that repository,
        including details about production branches, development branches, and
        any branch prefixes or patterns that are in use. This is particularly
        useful for understanding the workflow strategy implemented for the
        repository, whether it follows Git Flow, trunk-based development, or a
        custom branching strategy, and helps developers align their work with
        the established branch management conventions.

        This POST operation updates a specific environment within a Bitbucket
        repository by modifying its configuration settings. The endpoint
        requires three path parameters: the workspace identifier, repository
        slug, and the unique UUID of the environment to be updated. It allows
        teams to modify environment properties such as name, environment type,
        deployment restrictions, and other configuration details that govern how
        code is deployed to that particular environment. This is particularly
        useful for maintaining and adjusting deployment pipelines, updating
        access controls, or changing environment-specific settings as project
        requirements evolve. The operation requires appropriate authentication
        and permissions to modify deployment environments within the specified
        repository.

        This API operation retrieves the commit history for a specific file in a
        Bitbucket repository by listing all commits that have modified the file
        at the given path. The endpoint requires the workspace ID, repository
        slug, a specific commit SHA, and the file path as parameters. It returns
        a paginated list of commits in reverse chronological order, showing each
        commit that touched the specified file up to and including the provided
        commit reference. This is particularly useful for tracking changes to

        This API operation creates a fork of an existing Bitbucket repository
        within a specified workspace. By sending a POST request to the endpoint
        with the workspace identifier and repository slug, users can duplicate
        the repository into their own account or another workspace they have
        access to. The forked repository maintains a connection to the original
        source repository, allowing users to track changes and potentially
        submit pull requests back to the parent repository. This functionality
        is commonly used for contributing to open-source projects, creating
        experimental branches without affecting the original codebase, or
        maintaining personal copies of repositories for customization purposes.

        This API operation creates a new webhook for a specific Bitbucket
        repository within a workspace. When invoked via POST request to the
        endpoint /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/hooks, it allows you to
        configure automated notifications that trigger HTTP callbacks to a
        specified URL whenever certain events occur in the repository, such as
        push events, pull request updates, or issue changes. The workspace
        parameter identifies the Bitbucket workspace (formerly team), while
        repo_slug specifies the repository identifier. The request typically
        requires authentication and a JSON payload defining the webhook
        configuration, including the target URL, events to monitor, and optional
        settings like active status and description. Upon successful creation,
        the API returns the webhook details including a unique identifier that
        can be used for subsequent management operations like updates or
        deletion.

        This API operation retrieves details about a specific webhook configured
        for a Bitbucket repository. By providing the workspace identifier,
        repository slug, and unique webhook ID (uid) in the endpoint path, users
        can fetch comprehensive information about that particular webhook
        including its URL, events it subscribes to, configuration settings, and
        current status. This GET request is useful for inspecting existing
        webhook configurations, verifying webhook properties, or retrieving
        webhook details before performing update or delete operations. The
        response returns a complete webhook object containing all its attributes
        and settings as configured for the specified repository.

        The Export Issues endpoint allows users to trigger an export of all
        issues from a specific repository in Bitbucket. This POST operation is
        accessed via the path
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/issues/export, where workspace
        identifies the Bitbucket workspace and repo_slug specifies the
        repository containing the issues to be exported. When invoked, this API
        initiates an asynchronous export process that generates a downloadable
        file containing issue data from the repository, which can be useful for
        backup purposes, migration to other systems, reporting, or offline
        analysis. The exported data typically includes issue details such as
        titles, descriptions, status, priority, assignees, comments, and other
        metadata associated with the repository's issue tracker.

        This GET operation checks the status of a previously initiated issue
        export request for a specific Bitbucket repository by polling the export
        endpoint using the provided task ID. When called, it queries the export
        job identified by the workspace, repository slug, repository name, and
        unique task identifier to determine whether the export process is still
        running, has completed successfully, or has failed. If the export is

        issues data; otherwise, it provides status information about the ongoing
        export process. This allows users to monitor long-running export

        This API endpoint allows users to import issues in bulk to a Bitbucket
        repository by sending a POST request to
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/issues/import. It requires
        specifying the workspace identifier and repository slug in the URL path,
        and is designed to facilitate the migration or mass creation of issues
        from external sources or other issue tracking systems into a Bitbucket
        repository's issue tracker. The endpoint accepts issue data in the
        request body and processes multiple issues in a single operation, making
        it efficient for transferring large sets of issues while maintaining
        their properties and metadata during the import process.

        This API operation allows you to permanently delete a specific issue
        from a Bitbucket repository by sending a DELETE request to the endpoint
        with the workspace identifier, repository slug, and issue ID as path
        parameters. When executed successfully, it removes the issue and all
        associated data from the repository's issue tracker, making it an
        irreversible action that should be used with caution. The operation
        requires appropriate permissions within the workspace and repository to
        perform the deletion, and it's typically used for removing duplicate,
        spam, or mistakenly created issues from the project's issue tracking
        system.

        This POST operation allows you to modify the state of a specific issue
        within a Bitbucket repository by submitting change requests to the
        issue's change log. The endpoint requires three path parameters: the
        workspace identifier, the repository slug, and the issue ID you want to
        update. When called, it creates a new change entry that can update
        various issue properties such as status, priority, assignee, or other
        configurable fields depending on your repository's issue tracker
        settings. This operation is particularly useful for programmatically
        managing issue workflows, automating state transitions, or integrating
        external tools with Bitbucket's issue tracking system. The API expects
        the change data in the request body and returns the updated change
        record upon successful execution, making it essential for teams that
        want to maintain issue histories and track modifications across their
        development lifecycle.

        modify the content of a previously posted comment. The request requires
        authentication and appropriate permissions to edit the comment,

        This API operation allows you to remove your vote from a specific issue
        in a Bitbucket repository. By sending a DELETE request to the endpoint
        with the workspace identifier, repository slug, and issue ID, you can
        retract a previously cast vote on that issue. This is useful when you no
        longer wish to express support or priority for a particular issue,
        effectively decreasing its vote count and potentially affecting its
        perceived importance or ranking within the project's issue tracker.

        This GET endpoint checks whether the currently authenticated user has
        voted for a specific issue in a Bitbucket repository. By providing the
        workspace identifier, repository slug, and issue ID in the URL path, the
        API returns the voting status of the authenticated user for that
        particular issue. This operation is useful for applications that need to
        display voting state or manage user interactions with repository issues,
        allowing developers to determine if a user has already cast their vote
        before presenting voting options or updating the UI accordingly.

        This API endpoint allows authenticated users to cast a vote in support
        of a specific issue within a Bitbucket repository. By sending a PUT
        request to this endpoint with the appropriate workspace identifier,
        repository slug, and issue ID, users can register their interest or
        priority for a particular issue, helping repository maintainers
        understand which issues are most important to the community. The voting
        mechanism is commonly used to gauge user sentiment and prioritize bug
        fixes or feature requests, with the PUT method being idempotent, meaning
        multiple identical requests will have the same effect as a single
        request.

        This API endpoint allows authenticated users to start watching a
        specific issue in a Bitbucket repository by sending a PUT request to the
        specified path with the workspace identifier, repository slug, and issue
        ID. When executed successfully, the user will receive notifications
        about subsequent changes, comments, and updates to that particular
        issue. This is useful for staying informed about issues that are
        relevant to a user's work or interests without needing to manually check
        for updates. The operation requires appropriate authentication and the
        user must have at least read access to the repository containing the
        issue. The endpoint returns a successful response once the watch has
        been established for the authenticated user on the specified issue.

        This API operation retrieves the inheritance state configuration for

        can determine which repository settings are being inherited from the
        project level versus those that have been explicitly overridden at the
        repository level. This is particularly useful for administrators who
        need to understand the configuration hierarchy and manage settings
        inheritance across their Bitbucket workspace, allowing them to see which
        settings are using default project values and which have custom
        repository-specific configurations applied.

        This API operation allows administrators to configure the inheritance
        behavior of settings for a specific Bitbucket repository within a
        workspace. By making a PUT request to this endpoint, users can control
        whether repository settings should inherit values from the project or
        workspace level, or use custom overrides specific to that repository.
        This is particularly useful in organizations that want to enforce
        certain settings across multiple repositories while allowing selective
        customization for specific repos. The operation requires specification
        of both the workspace identifier and the repository slug in the URL
        path, and the request body typically contains the inheritance
        configuration that determines which settings should be inherited and
        which should be overridden at the repository level.

        group on a Bitbucket repository within a workspace. By sending a PUT
        request to the endpoint with the workspace identifier, repository slug,
        and group slug, administrators can modify the access rights granted to
        that group for the specified repository. The operation allows you to
        change permission levels such as read, write, or admin access for the
        group, providing fine-grained control over repository access management.
        This is particularly useful for managing team permissions and ensuring
        that user groups have appropriate access levels based on their roles and
        responsibilities within the organization.

        This API operation retrieves a list of explicit user permissions that
        have been directly assigned to a specific Bitbucket repository within a
        given workspace. By making a GET request to the endpoint with the
        workspace identifier and repository slug as path parameters, it returns
        detailed information about individual users who have been granted
        specific permission levels on the repository, excluding permissions
        inherited through group memberships or workspace-level settings. This is
        useful for repository administrators who need to audit, review, or
        manage direct user access controls and understand exactly which users
        have been explicitly granted permissions such as read, write, or admin
        access to the repository.

        This API operation removes an explicitly granted permission for a
        specific user from a Bitbucket repository by sending a DELETE request to
        the endpoint
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/permissions-config/users/{selected_user_id}.
        The operation requires three path parameters: the workspace identifier,
        the repository slug, and the selected user's ID whose permission is
        being revoked. When executed, it deletes the direct permission
        assignment for that user on the specified repository, meaning the user
        will no longer have the explicitly granted access level unless they
        inherit permissions through group membership or workspace-level
        settings. This is useful for repository administrators who need to
        revoke individual user access without affecting other users or
        group-based permissions.

        repository within a workspace. This operation requires specifying the
        workspace identifier, repository slug, and the selected user's ID in the

        group-based permissions, enabling precise control over who can view,
        contribute to, or administer the repository.

        The Run Pipeline operation in Atlassian Bitbucket's Repositories API
        allows users to programmatically trigger a pipeline execution for a
        specific repository by making a POST request to the
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pipelines endpoint. This operation
        requires specifying the workspace and repository slug in the URL path,
        and typically accepts a request body containing configuration details
        such as the target branch, commit, or pipeline selector to determine
        which pipeline definition should be executed. When successfully invoked,
        it initiates the CI/CD pipeline process, returning information about the
        newly created pipeline run including its UUID and current state,
        enabling automation of builds, tests, and deployments without manual
        intervention through the Bitbucket web interface.

        specific repository's pipeline in Bitbucket. By targeting the
        pipelines-config/caches endpoint under a particular workspace and
        repository slug, it returns information about the caching configurations
        that have been set up to optimize build times by storing dependencies
        and other reusable build artifacts. The response typically includes
        details such as cache names, sizes, and related metadata that help
        developers understand what content is being cached for their CI/CD
        pipelines. This endpoint is useful for monitoring cache usage,

        The Atlassian Bitbucket Repositories API delete operation on the
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pipelines-config/caches endpoint
        allows users to remove cached data associated with a specific
        repository's pipeline configuration. This operation requires
        authentication and proper permissions within the specified workspace and
        repository. When invoked, it clears the pipeline caches that have been
        stored to optimize build times, forcing subsequent pipeline runs to
        rebuild dependencies and artifacts from scratch. This is particularly
        useful when cached data becomes corrupted, outdated, or when you need to
        ensure a clean build environment. The operation accepts the workspace
        identifier and repository slug as path parameters to target the specific
        repository whose pipeline caches should be deleted.

      description: >-
        This API operation retrieves the log file for a specific step within a
        Bitbucket pipeline. By providing the workspace ID, repository slug,
        pipeline UUID, and step UUID, you can access the detailed execution logs
        generated during that particular pipeline step. The logs contain console
        output, error messages, and other diagnostic information that occurred
        while the step was running, which is useful for debugging failed builds,
        monitoring deployment processes, or auditing pipeline execution history.
        This endpoint returns the raw log content that was captured during the
        step's execution in the CI/CD pipeline.

        The Delete Schedule operation in the Atlassian Bitbucket Repositories

        This operation requires three path parameters: the workspace identifier,
        the repository slug, and the unique UUID of the schedule to be deleted.
        When executed successfully, it permanently removes the automated
        pipeline execution schedule from the specified repository, preventing
        any future pipeline runs that were configured under that schedule. This
        is useful for cleaning up outdated or no longer needed automation

        This API operation removes a specific SSH known host entry from a
        Bitbucket repository's Pipelines configuration by providing the
        workspace identifier, repository slug, and the unique UUID of the known
        host to be deleted. Known hosts are SSH server fingerprints that
        Pipelines uses to verify the identity of remote servers during SSH
        connections, and deleting a known host entry means that the repository's
        pipeline will no longer have that server's SSH key fingerprint stored
        for authentication purposes. This DELETE request is typically used when
        a known host is no longer needed, has been compromised, or when the
        server's SSH keys have changed and need to be re-added with updated
        fingerprints. The operation requires appropriate authentication and
        authorization permissions for the specified repository and workspace,
        and upon successful deletion, the known host will be permanently removed
        from the Pipelines SSH configuration for that repository.

      description: >-
        This API operation retrieves all pipeline variables configured for a
        specific Bitbucket repository within a given workspace. By making a GET
        request to the endpoint with the workspace identifier and repository
        slug, users can access a complete list of environment variables that are
        available for use during pipeline executions. These variables typically
        include configuration settings, credentials, and other key-value pairs
        that pipelines reference during build, test, and deployment processes.
        The operation returns variable metadata including names, values (with
        sensitive values potentially masked), security settings, and whether
        variables are secured or public. This is useful for auditing pipeline
        configurations, managing environment-specific settings, and ensuring
        proper variable setup across different repositories in the workspace.

        This API operation creates a new pipeline variable for a specific
        Bitbucket repository within a workspace. By sending a POST request to
        the endpoint with the workspace ID and repository slug, users can define
        custom variables that will be available during pipeline executions.
        These variables are commonly used to store configuration values,
        credentials, or environment-specific settings that pipelines need to

      description: >-
        This API operation retrieves a specific application property stored
        against a Bitbucket repository within a given workspace. By providing
        the workspace identifier, repository slug, application key, and property
        name as path parameters, developers can fetch custom metadata or
        configuration values that have been previously set by an application for
        that particular repository. This is useful for applications that need to
        store and retrieve repository-specific settings or data, such as
        integration configurations, feature flags, or custom attributes that
        extend the repository's functionality beyond Bitbucket's native
        features.

          The request URL you POST to becomes the destination repository URL.
          For this reason, you must specify an explicit source repository in the
          request object if you want to pull from a different repository (fork).


          Since not all elements are required or even mutable, you only need to
          include the elements you want to initialize, such as the source branch
          and the title.

        This API operation removes a user's approval from a specific pull
        request in a Bitbucket repository. By sending a DELETE request to the
        endpoint with the workspace identifier, repository slug, and pull
        request ID, an authenticated user can retract their previously given
        approval for that pull request. This is useful when a reviewer needs to
        withdraw their approval due to new concerns, additional changes
        required, or if they want to re-review the code after new commits have
        been added. The operation requires appropriate permissions within the
        repository and affects the pull request's approval status, potentially
        impacting merge requirements if the repository has configured a minimum
        number of approvals needed before merging.

        This operation allows an authenticated user to approve a specific pull
        request within a Bitbucket repository by sending a POST request to the
        endpoint with the workspace identifier, repository slug, and pull
        request ID as path parameters. When executed, it registers the user's
        approval vote for the pull request, indicating they have reviewed the
        proposed changes and agree they should be merged into the target branch.
        The approval is typically used as part of a code review workflow and may
        be required before the pull request can be merged, depending on the
        repository's merge checks and branch permissions settings. The operation
        returns details about the approval status and requires the user to have
        appropriate permissions to review pull requests in the specified
        repository.

        in a Bitbucket repository by marking it as resolved, indicating that the
        discussion or issue raised in the comment has been addressed or is no

      description: >-
        This API endpoint allows an authorized user to decline an open pull
        request in a Bitbucket repository by making a POST request to the
        specified path with the workspace name, repository slug, and pull
        request ID as parameters. When invoked, it marks the pull request as
        declined, effectively rejecting the proposed changes without merging
        them into the target branch. The operation requires appropriate
        permissions and can only be performed on pull requests that are in an
        open state. Upon successful execution, the pull request's state is
        updated to declined, and the operation cannot be undone through the API,
        though the pull request can be reopened if needed. This is typically
        used when a pull request's changes are no longer needed, don't meet
        project standards, or when an alternative solution has been chosen.

        This API operation merges a pull request in a Bitbucket repository by
        sending a POST request to the specified endpoint with the workspace
        name, repository slug, and pull request ID. When executed, it attempts
        to merge the source branch into the destination branch of the pull
        request, effectively incorporating the proposed changes into the target
        branch. The operation requires appropriate permissions and will only
        succeed if the pull request is in a mergeable state with no conflicts,
        all required approvals are met, and any configured merge checks have
        passed. Upon successful execution, the API returns details about the
        merge commit and updates the pull request status to merged, optionally
        closing the source branch if configured to do so.

        This API endpoint retrieves the current status of a merge task for a
        specific pull request in a Bitbucket repository. By providing the
        workspace identifier, repository slug, pull request ID, and task ID in
        the URL path, you can query whether a merge operation is still in
        progress, has completed successfully, or has failed. This is
        particularly useful for monitoring asynchronous merge operations, as
        merging pull requests can sometimes be a time-consuming process
        depending on repository size, conflicts, and post-merge hooks. The
        endpoint returns status information that helps developers track merge
        operations without having to repeatedly check the pull request state
        manually, enabling better automation and integration with CI/CD
        pipelines.

        The Get The Patch For Pull Request operation in the Atlassian Bitbucket
        Repositories API retrieves a unified diff patch representation of a
        specific pull request by making a GET request to the endpoint
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pullrequests/{pull_request_id}/patch.
        This endpoint requires three path parameters: the workspace identifier,
        the repository slug, and the pull request ID. When invoked, it returns
        the complete patch file showing all code changes included in the pull
        request in standard unified diff format, which can be used for code
        review, applying changes to other branches, or integrating with external
        tools that consume patch files. This operation is particularly useful
        for developers who need to programmatically access pull request changes
        outside of the Bitbucket web interface or integrate pull request data
        into custom workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

        This API operation removes a change request from a specific pull request
        in a Bitbucket repository. When invoked, it deletes an existing request
        for changes that was previously submitted on the pull request identified
        by the pull_request_id within the specified repository (repo_slug) and
        workspace. This DELETE endpoint allows users to retract their feedback
        indicating that changes were needed, typically used when the reviewer no
        longer requires modifications to be made to the pull request or wants to
        update their review status. The operation requires authentication and
        appropriate permissions to modify reviews on the target pull request.

        request to the endpoint with the workspace identifier, repository slug,
        and pull request ID, reviewers can indicate that modifications are

        typically changes the pull request's review status and notifies the pull
        request author that revisions are required, facilitating the code review
        process by providing a clear signal that the current implementation
        needs improvement or corrections before it can be accepted into the

        request ID, and task ID, you can permanently remove a task that was
        previously created on a pull request. This is useful for cleaning up
        completed tasks, removing tasks that were created in error, or managing
        the task list associated with code review workflows. The operation
        requires appropriate permissions to modify tasks on the specified pull
        request within the repository.

        This API operation retrieves detailed information about a specific task
        associated with a pull request in a Bitbucket repository. By providing
        the workspace identifier, repository slug, pull request ID, and task ID
        in the endpoint path, developers can fetch the task's current state,
        description, assignee information, creation date, and completion status.
        This is useful for tracking code review action items, follow-up work, or
        specific issues that need to be addressed within the context of a pull
        request, enabling teams to manage their code review workflow more
        effectively and ensure all tasks are completed before merging changes
        into the codebase.

        The Create Branch operation in the Atlassian Bitbucket Repositories API
        allows developers to programmatically create a new branch within a
        specified repository by sending a POST request to the
        /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/refs/branches endpoint. This
        operation requires authentication and takes the workspace identifier and
        repository slug as path parameters, along with a request body that
        typically includes the new branch name and the source commit or existing
        branch from which to create it. Upon successful execution, the API
        returns details about the newly created branch including its name,
        target commit hash, and associated metadata, enabling automated branch
        management workflows for version control and continuous integration
        processes.

        This API operation allows you to delete a specific branch from a
        repository in Bitbucket Cloud. By sending a DELETE request to the
        endpoint with the workspace ID, repository slug, and branch name, you
        can permanently remove the specified branch from the repository. This is
        useful for cleaning up merged feature branches, removing obsolete code
        branches, or managing your repository's branch structure. The operation
        requires appropriate permissions on the repository, and once executed,
        the branch and its reference will be removed, though the commits
        themselves may still be accessible through the repository's history if
        they were previously merged or referenced elsewhere.

        This API operation retrieves detailed information about a specific
        branch within a Bitbucket repository. By providing the workspace
        identifier, repository slug, and branch name in the endpoint path, users
        can fetch comprehensive data about the target branch including its
        latest commit details, author information, commit hash, and other
        branch-specific metadata. This is particularly useful for applications
        that need to programmatically access branch information for CI/CD
        pipelines, deployment workflows, or repository management tasks without
        having to clone the entire repository or traverse the full commit
        history.

        This API operation retrieves a paginated list of all tags in a specified
        Bitbucket repository within a given workspace. By making a GET request
        to the endpoint with the workspace identifier and repository slug as
        path parameters, users can fetch metadata about repository tags, which
        are references that point to specific commits in the version control
        history. The response typically includes information such as tag names,
        target commit hashes, creation dates, and associated metadata, allowing
        developers to programmatically access and manage repository tags for
        version control, release management, and deployment workflows.

        The Create Tag operation in the Atlassian Bitbucket Repositories API
        allows users to create a new tag in a specified repository by sending a
        POST request to the /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/refs/tags
        endpoint. This operation requires the workspace identifier and
        repository slug as path parameters to target the specific repository
        where the tag should be created. The request typically includes details
        such as the tag name, the target commit hash or reference to which the
        tag should point, and optional metadata like a message or tagger
        information. This endpoint is commonly used in version control workflows
        to mark specific points in a repository's history, such as releases or
        important milestones, making it easier to reference and retrieve
        specific versions of the codebase. Successful execution returns the
        newly created tag object with its properties, while authentication and
        appropriate repository permissions are required to perform this
        operation.

        This API operation allows you to delete a specific tag from a Bitbucket
        repository by making a DELETE request to the endpoint with the workspace
        identifier, repository slug, and tag name as path parameters. When
        executed, it permanently removes the named tag reference from the
        specified repository, though it's important to note that this action
        does not delete the commit that the tag was pointing to, only the tag
        reference itself. This is useful for removing obsolete or incorrectly
        created tags from your repository's version control system, and
        typically requires appropriate write permissions on the repository to
        execute successfully.

        The GET operation on /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/src endpoint
        in the Atlassian Bitbucket Repositories API retrieves the contents of
        the root directory from the main branch of a specified repository. By
        providing the workspace identifier and repository slug in the path
        parameters, this endpoint returns a paginated list of files and
        directories located at the repository's root level, including metadata
        such as file names, paths, sizes, and commit information. This operation
        is useful for browsing repository structure, displaying directory
        contents in user interfaces, or programmatically navigating through
        repository files without cloning the entire repository locally.

        This operation allows you to create a new commit in a Bitbucket
        repository by uploading one or more files directly through the API. You
        specify the target workspace and repository via the path parameters,
        then provide the file content along with commit metadata such as the
        commit message, branch name, author information, and optional parent
        commit references in the request body. The files are uploaded as
        multipart form data, where each file can be specified with its path in
        the repository and its content. Upon successful execution, the API
        creates a new commit containing the uploaded files and returns details
        about the newly created commit including its hash, timestamp, and author
        information. This is particularly useful for automating file updates,
        CI/CD pipelines, or any workflow that needs to programmatically modify
        repository contents without requiring a local git clone or manual file
        operations.

          description: |

            Optional field that declares the files that the request is
            manipulating. When adding a new file to a repo, or when
            overwriting an existing file, the client can just upload
            the full contents of the file in a normal form field and
            the use of this `files` meta data field is redundant.
            However, when the `files` field contains a file path that
            does not have a corresponding, identically-named form
            field, then Bitbucket interprets that as the client wanting
            to replace the named file with the null set and the file is
            deleted instead.

            Paths in the repo that are referenced in neither files nor
            an individual file field, remain unchanged and carry over
            from the parent to the new commit.

            This API does not support renaming as an explicit feature.
            To rename a file, simply delete it and recreate it under
            the new name in the same commit.

            The name of the branch that the new commit should be
            created on. When omitted, the commit will be created on top
            of the main branch and will become the main branch's new
            head.

            When a branch name is provided that already exists in the
            repo, then the commit will be created on top of that
            branch. In this case, *if* a parent SHA1 was also provided,
            then it is asserted that the parent is the branch's
            tip/HEAD at the time the request is made. When this is not
            the case, a 409 is returned.

            When a new branch name is specified (that does not already
            exist in the repo), and no parent SHA1s are provided, then
            the new commit will inherit from the current main branch's
            tip/HEAD commit, but not advance the main branch. The new
            commit will be the new branch. When the request *also*
            specifies a parent SHA1, then the new commit and branch
            are created directly on top of the parent commit,
            regardless of the state of the main branch.

            When a branch name is not specified, but a parent SHA1 is
            provided, then Bitbucket asserts that it represents the
            main branch's current HEAD/tip, or a 409 is returned.

            When a branch name is not specified and the repo is empty,
            the new commit will become the repo's root commit and will
            be on the main branch.

            When a branch name is specified and the repo is empty, the
            new commit will become the repo's root commit and also
            define the repo's main branch going forward.

            This API cannot be used to create additional root commits
            in non-empty repos.

            The branch field cannot be repeated.

            As a side effect, this API can be used to create a new
            branch without modifying any files, by specifying a new
            branch name in this field, together with `parents`, but
            omitting the `files` fields, while not sending any files.
            This will create a new commit and branch with the same
            contents as the first parent. The diff of this commit
            against its first parent will be empty.

        This GET operation retrieves the raw content of a file or the contents
        of a directory from a specific Bitbucket repository at a particular
        commit. By providing the workspace identifier, repository slug, commit
        hash or branch name, and the file or directory path, users can access
        the exact state of their source code at any point in the repository's
        history. When targeting a file, the endpoint returns the raw file
        content, while targeting a directory returns a listing of its contents
        including files and subdirectories with their metadata, making it
        essential for browsing repository structure, retrieving specific
        versions of files, or implementing custom code review and analysis
        tools.

        This API endpoint retrieves a paginated list of all defined versions
        associated with a specific repository in Bitbucket. By making a GET
        request to /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/versions, users can
        access version information that is typically used for issue tracking and
        release management within the repository. The endpoint requires two path

        version objects that may include details such as version names,
        identifiers, and metadata that teams use to categorize and track issues
        across different releases or milestones of their software project.

        Returns a paginated list of all users watching the specified repository.
        Authenticated users can use this endpoint to discover who is following
        updates to a repository, including receiving notifications about
        commits, pull requests, and issues. The response includes user account
        information for each watcher. This endpoint supports pagination through
        standard query parameters to handle repositories with large numbers of
        watchers. Access requires appropriate repository read permissions, with
        the level of detail returned depending on the authenticated user's
        privileges and the repository's visibility settings.

        This API operation retrieves all explicit user and group permissions for
        a specific repository within a given workspace in Bitbucket. By
        providing the workspace identifier and repository slug as path
        parameters, it returns a paginated list of permission grants that shows
        which users and groups have been explicitly granted access to the
        repository and their respective permission levels (such as read, write,
        or admin). This is useful for auditing repository access, managing team
        permissions, and understanding who has what level of access to a
        particular repository within the workspace, excluding any permissions
        that might be inherited from workspace-level settings.

        ### Basic auth


        Basic HTTP Authentication as per
        [RFC-2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) (Digest not supported).

        Note that Basic Auth is available only with username and [app
        password](https://bitbucket.org/account/settings/app-passwords/) as
        credentials.


        ### Access Tokens


        Access Tokens are passwords (or tokens) that provide access to a
        _single_ repository, project or workspace.

        These tokens can authenticate with Bitbucket APIs for scripting, CI/CD
        tools, Bitbucket Cloud-connected apps,

        and Bitbucket Cloud integrations.


        Access Tokens are linked to a repository, project, or workspace, not a
        user account.

        The level of access provided by the token is set when a repository, or
        workspace admin creates it,

        by setting permission scopes.


        There are three types of Access Token:


        * **Repository Access Tokens** can connect to a single repository,
        preventing them from accessing any other repositories or workspaces.

        * **Project Access Tokens** can connect to a single project, providing
        access to any repositories within the project.

        * **Workspace Access Tokens** can connect to a single workspace and have
        access to any projects and repositories within that workspace.


        When using Bitbucket APIs with an Access Token, the token will be
        treated as the "user" in the

        Bitbucket UI and Bitbucket logs. This includes when using the Access
        Token to leave a comment on a pull request,

        push a commit, or merge a pull request. The Bitbucket UI and API
        responses will show the

        Repository/Project/Workspace Access Token as a user. The username shown
        in the Bitbucket UI is the Access

        Token _name_, and a custom icon is used to differentiate it from a
        regular user in the UI.


        #### Considerations for using Access Tokens


        * After creation, an Access Token can't be viewed or modified. The
        token's name, created date,

        last accessed date, and scopes are visible on the repository, project,
        or workspace **Access Tokens** page.

        * Access Tokens can access a limited set of Bitbucket's permission
        scopes.

        * Provided you set the correct permission scopes, you can use an Access
        Token to clone (`repository`)

        and push (`repository:write`) code to the token's repository or the
        repositories the token can access.

        * You can't use an Access Token to log into the Bitbucket website.

        * Access Tokens don't require two-step verification.

        * You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for each Access
        Token.

        * You can't use an Access Token to manipulate or query repository,
        project, or workspace permissions.

        * Access Tokens are not listed in any repository or workspace permission
        API response.

        * Access Tokens are deactivated when deleting the resource tied to it (a
        repository, project, or workspace).

        Repository Access Tokens are also revoked when transferring the
        repository to another workspace.

        * Any content created by the Access Token will persist after the Access
        Token has been revoked.

        * Access Tokens can interact with branch restriction APIs, but the token
        can't be configured as a user with merge access when using branch
        restrictions.


        There are some APIs which are inaccessible for Access Tokens, these are:


        * [Add a repository deploy
        key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-post)

        * [Update a repository deploy
        key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-key-id-put)

        * [Delete a repository deploy
        key](/cloud/bitbucket/rest/api-group-deployments/#api-repositories-workspace-repo-slug-deploy-keys-key-id-delete)

        ### App passwords


        App passwords allow users to make API calls to their Bitbucket account
        through apps such as Sourcetree.


        Some important points about app passwords:


        * You cannot view an app password or adjust permissions after you create
        the app password. Because app passwords are encrypted on our database
        and cannot be viewed by anyone. They are essentially designed to be
        disposable. If you need to change the scopes or lost the password just
        create a new one.

        * You cannot use them to log into your Bitbucket account.

        * You cannot use app passwords to manage team actions.

            App passwords are tied to an individual account's credentials and should not be shared. If you're sharing your app password you're essentially giving direct, authenticated, access to everything that password has been scoped to do with the Bitbucket API's.

        * You can use them for API call authentication, even if you don't have
        two-step verification enabled.

        * You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for each app
        password.


        For details on creating, managing, and using App passwords, visit

        [App
        passwords](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/).


        ### OAuth 2.0


        Our OAuth 2 implementation is merged in with our existing OAuth 1 in

        such a way that existing OAuth 1 consumers automatically become

        valid OAuth 2 clients. The only thing you need to do is edit your

        existing consumer and configure a callback URL.


        Once that is in place, you'll have the following 2 URLs:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token

        For obtaining access/bearer tokens, we support three of RFC-6749's grant

        flows, plus a custom Bitbucket flow for exchanging JWT tokens for access
        tokens.

        Note that Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (4.3) is no longer
        supported.



        #### 1. Authorization Code Grant (4.1)


        The full-blown 3-LO flow. Request authorization from the end user by

        sending their browser to:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=code

        The callback includes the `?code={}` query parameter that you can swap

        for an access token:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code={code}


        #### 2. Implicit Grant (4.2)


        This flow is useful for browser-based add-ons that operate without
        server-side backends.


        Request the end user for authorization by directing the browser to:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=token

        That will redirect to your preconfigured callback URL with a fragment

        containing the access token

        (`#access_token={token}&token_type=bearer`) where your page's js can

        pull it out of the URL.



        #### 3. Client Credentials Grant (4.4)


        Somewhat like our existing "2-LO" flow for OAuth 1. Obtain an access

        token that represents not an end user, but the owner of the

        client/consumer:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=client_credentials


        #### 4. Bitbucket Cloud JWT Grant (urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt)


        If your Atlassian Connect add-on uses JWT authentication, you can swap a

        JWT for an OAuth access token. The resulting access token represents the

        account for which the add-on is installed.


        Make sure you send the JWT token in the Authorization request header

        using the "JWT" scheme (case sensitive). Note that this custom scheme

        makes this different from HTTP Basic Auth (and so you cannot use "curl

        -u").

            $ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: JWT {jwt_token}" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt


        #### Making Requests


        Once you have an access token, as per RFC-6750, you can use it in a
        request in any of

        the following ways (in decreasing order of desirability):


        1. Send it in a request header: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`

        2. Include it in a (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) POST body as
        `access_token={access_token}`

        3. Put it in the query string of a non-POST:
        `?access_token={access_token}`



        #### Repository Cloning


        Since add-ons will not be able to upload their own SSH keys to clone

        with, access tokens can be used as Basic HTTP Auth credentials to

        clone securely over HTTPS. This is much like GitHub, yet slightly

        different:

            $ git clone https://x-token-auth:{access_token}@bitbucket.org/user/repo.git

        The literal string `x-token-auth` as a substitute for username is

        required (note the difference with GitHub where the actual token is in

        the username field).



        #### Refresh Tokens


        Our access tokens expire in one hour. When this happens you'll get 401

        responses.


        Most access tokens grant responses (Implicit and JWT excluded).
        Therefore, you should include a

        refresh token that can then be used to generate a new access token,

        without the need for end user participation:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=refresh_token -d refresh_token={refresh_token}


        ### Bitbucket OAuth 2.0 scopes


        Bitbucket's API applies a number of privilege scopes to endpoints. In
        order to access an endpoint, a request will need to have the necessary
        scopes.


        OAuth 2.0 Scopes are applicable for OAuth 2, Access Tokens, and App
        passwords auth mechanisms as well as Bitbucket Connect apps.


        Scopes are declared in the descriptor as a list of strings, with each
        string being the name of a unique scope.


        A descriptor lacking the `scopes` element is implicitly assumed to
        require all scopes and as a result, Bitbucket will require end users
        authorizing/installing the add-on

        to explicitly accept all scopes.


        Our best practice suggests you add only the scopes your add-on needs,
        but no more than it needs.


        Invalid scope strings will cause the descriptor to be rejected and the
        installation to fail.


        The available scopes are:


        - [project](#project)

        - [project:write](#project-write)

        - [project:admin](#project-admin)

        - [repository](#repository)

        - [runner](#runner)

        - [runner:write](#runner-write)


        #### project


        Provides access to view the project or projects.

        This scope implies the [`repository`](#repository) scope, giving read
        access to all the repositories in a project or projects.


        #### project:write


        This scope is deprecated, and has been made obsolete by `project:admin`.
        Please see the deprecation notice
        [here](/cloud/bitbucket/deprecation-notice-project-write-scope).


        #### project:admin


        Provides admin access to a project or projects. No distinction is made
        between public and private projects. This scope doesn't implicitly grant
        the [`project`](#project) scope or the
        [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope on any repositories under
        the project. It gives access to the admin features of a project only,
        not direct access to its repositories' contents.


        * ability to create the project

        * ability to update the project

        * ability to delete the project


        #### repository


        Provides read access to a repository or repositories.

        Note that this scope does not give access to a repository's pull
        requests.


        * access to the repo's source code

        * clone over HTTPS

        * access the file browsing API

        * download zip archives of the repo's contents

        * the ability to view and use the issue tracker on any repo (created
        issues, comment, vote, etc)

        * the ability to view and use the wiki on any repo (create/edit pages)


        #### repository:write


        Provides write (not admin) access to a repository or repositories. No
        distinction is made between public and private repositories. This scope
        implicitly grants the [`repository`](#repository) scope, which does not
        need to be requested separately.

        This scope alone does not give access to the pull requests API.


        * push access over HTTPS

        * fork repos


        #### repository:admin


        Provides admin access to a repository or repositories. No distinction is
        made between public and private repositories. This scope doesn't
        implicitly grant the [`repository`](#repository) or the
        [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scopes. It gives access to the
        admin features of a repo only, not direct access to its contents. This
        scope can be used or misused to grant read access to other users, who
        can then clone the repo, but users that need to read and write source
        code would also request explicit read or write.

        This scope comes with access to the following functionality:


        * View and manipulate committer mappings

        * List and edit deploy keys

        * Ability to delete the repo

        * View and edit repo permissions

        * View and edit branch permissions

        * Import and export the issue tracker

        * Enable and disable the issue tracker

        * List and edit issue tracker version, milestones and components

        * Enable and disable the wiki

        * List and edit default reviewers

        * List and edit repo links (Jira/Bamboo/Custom)

        * List and edit the repository webhooks

        * Initiate a repo ownership transfer


        #### repository:delete


        Provides access to delete a repository or repositories.


        #### pullrequest


        Provides read access to pull requests.

        This scope implies the [`repository`](#repository) scope, giving read
        access to the pull request's destination repository.


        * see and list pull requests

        * create and resolve tasks

        * comment on pull requests


        #### pullrequest:write


        Implicitly grants the [`pullrequest`](#pullrequest) scope and adds the
        ability to create, merge and decline pull requests.

        This scope also implicitly grants the
        [`repository:write`](#repository-write) scope, giving write access to
        the pull request's destination repository. This is necessary to allow
        merging.


        * merge pull requests

        * decline pull requests

        * create pull requests

        * approve pull requests


        #### issue


        Ability to interact with issue trackers the way non-repo members can.

        This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give
        implicit access to the repository.


        * view, list and search issues

        * create new issues

        * comment on issues

        * watch issues

        * vote for issues


        #### issue:write


        This scope implicitly grants the [`issue`](#issue) scope and adds the
        ability to transition and delete issues.

        This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give
        implicit access to the repository.


        * transition issues

        * delete issues


        #### wiki


        Provides access to wikis. This scope provides both read and write access
        (wikis are always editable by anyone with access to them).

        This scope doesn't implicitly grant any other scopes and doesn't give
        implicit access to the repository.


        * view wikis

        * create pages

        * edit pages

        * push to wikis

        * clone wikis


        #### webhook


        Gives access to webhooks. This scope is required for any webhook-related
        operation.


        This scope gives read access to existing webhook subscriptions on all

        resources the authorization mechanism can access, without needing
        further scopes.

        For example:


        - A client can list all existing webhook subscriptions on a repository.
        The [`repository`](#repository) scope is not required.

        - Existing webhook subscriptions for the issue tracker on a repo can be
        retrieved without the [`issue`](#issue) scope. All that is required is
        the `webhook` scope.


        To create webhooks, the client will need read access to the resource.
        Such as: for [`issue:created`](#issue-created), the client will need to

        have both the `webhook` and the [`issue`](#issue) scope.


        * list webhook subscriptions on any accessible repository, user, team,
        or snippet

        * create/update/delete webhook subscriptions.


        #### snippet


        Provides read access to snippets.

        No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public
        snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).


        * view any snippet

        * create snippet comments


        #### snippet:write


        Provides write access to snippets.

        No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public
        snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).

        This scope implicitly grants the [`snippet`](#snippet) scope which does
        not need to be requested separately.


        * create snippets

        * edit snippets

        * delete snippets


        #### email


        Ability to see the user's primary email address. This should make it
        easier to use Bitbucket Cloud as a login provider for apps or external
        applications.


        #### account


        When used for:

        * **user-related APIs**  Gives read-only access to the user's account
        information.

        Note that this doesn't include any ability to change any of the data.
        This scope allows you to view the user's:
          * email addresses
          * language
          * location
          * website
          * full name
          * SSH keys
          * user groups
        * **workspace-related APIs**  Grants access to view the workspace's:
          * users
          * user permissions
          * projects

        #### account:write


        Ability to change properties on the user's account.


        * delete the authorizing user's account

        * manage the user's groups

        * change a user's email addresses

        * change username, display name and avatar


        #### pipeline


        Gives read-only access to pipelines, steps, deployment environments and
        variables.


        #### pipeline:write


        Gives write access to pipelines. This scope allows a user to:

        * Stop pipelines

        * Rerun failed pipelines

        * Resume halted pipelines

        * Trigger manual pipelines.


        This scope is not needed to trigger a build using a push. Performing a
        `git push` (or equivalent actions) will trigger the build. The token
        doing the push only needs the [`repository:write`](#repository-write)
        scope.


        This doesn't give write access to create variables.


        #### pipeline:variable


        Gives write access to create variables in pipelines at the various
        levels:

        * Workspace

        * Repository

        * Deployment


        #### runner


        Gives read-only access to pipelines runners setup against a workspace or
        repository.


        #### runner:write


        Gives write access to create/edit/disable/delete pipelines runners setup
        against a workspace or repository.

        ### Forge app scopes


        In order for a Forge app integration to access Bitbucket API endpoints,
        it needs to include certain privilege scopes in the app manifest. These
        are different from Bitbucket OAuth 2.0 scopes.


        Unlike OAuth 2.0 scopes, Forge app scopes do not implicitly grant other
        scopes, for example, `write:repository:bitbucket` does not implicitly
        grant `read:repository:bitbucket`.


        Only a subset of Bitbucket API endpoints are currently available for
        Forge app integrations. These will be labeled with Forge app scopes.


        Our best practice suggests you only add the scopes your app needs, but
        no more than it needs.


        The available scopes are:


        - [`read:repository:bitbucket`](#read-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`write:repository:bitbucket`](#write-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`admin:repository:bitbucket`](#admin-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`delete:repository:bitbucket`](#delete-repository-bitbucket)

        - [`read:pullrequest:bitbucket`](#read-pullrequest-bitbucket)

        - [`write:pullrequest:bitbucket`](#write-pullrequest-bitbucket)

        - [`read:project:bitbucket`](#read-project-bitbucket)

        - [`admin:project:bitbucket`](#admin-project-bitbucket)

        - [`read:workspace:bitbucket`](#read-workspace-bitbucket)

        - [`read:user:bitbucket`](#read-user-bitbucket)

        - [`read:pipeline:bitbucket`](#read-pipeline-bitbucket)

        - [`write:pipeline:bitbucket`](#write-pipeline-bitbucket)

        - [`admin:pipeline:bitbucket`](#admin-pipeline-bitbucket)

        - [`read:runner:bitbucket`](#read-runner-bitbucket)

        - [`write:runner:bitbucket`](#write-runner-bitbucket)


        #### read:repository:bitbucket


        Allows viewing of repository data. Note that this scope does not give
        access to a repository's pull requests.

        * access to the repository's source code

        * access the file browsing API

        * access to certain repository configurations such as branching model,
        default reviewers, etc.


        #### write:repository:bitbucket


        Allows modification of repository data. No distinction is made between
        public and private repositories. This scope does not imply the
        `read:repository:bitbucket` scope, so you need to request that
        separately if required. This scope alone does not give access to the
        pull request API.

        * update/delete source, branches, tags, etc.

        * fork repositories


        #### admin:repository:bitbucket


        Allows admin activities on repositories. No distinction is made between
        public and private repositories. This scope does not implicitly grant
        the `read:repository:bitbucket` or the `write:repository:bitbucket`
        scopes. It gives access to the admin features of a repository only, not
        direct access to its contents. This scope does not allow modification of
        repository permissions. This scope comes with access to the following
        functionality:

        * create repository

        * view repository permissions

        * view and edit branch restrictions

        * edit branching model settings

        * edit default reviewers

        * view and edit inheritance state for repository settings


        #### delete:repository:bitbucket

        Allows deletion of repositories.


        #### read:pullrequest:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of pull requests, plus the ability to comment on pull
        requests.


        This scope does not imply the `read:repository:bitbucket` scope. With
        this scope, you could retrieve some data specific to the
        source/destination repositories of a pull request using pull request
        endpoints, but it does not give access to repository API endpoints.


        #### write:pullrequest:bitbucket

        Allows the ability to create, update, approve, decline, and merge pull
        requests.


        This scope does not imply the `write:repository:bitbucket` scope.


        #### read:project:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of project and project permission data.


        #### admin:project:bitbucket

        Allows the ability to create, update, and delete project. No distinction
        is made between public and private projects.


        This scope does not implicitly grant the `read:project:bitbucket` scope
        or any repository scopes. It gives access to the admin features of a
        project only, not direct access to its repositories' contents.


        #### read:workspace:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of workspace and workspace permission data.


        #### read:user:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of user data. This scope is typically required for
        permission related endpoints.


        #### read:pipeline:bitbucket

        Allows read access to all pipeline information (pipelines, steps,
        caches, artifacts, logs, tests, code-insights).


        #### write:pipeline:bitbucket

        Allows running pipelines (i.e., start/stop/create pipeline) and
        uploading tests/code-insights.


        This scope does not imply the `read:pipeline:bitbucket` scope.


        #### admin:pipeline:bitbucket

        Allows admin activities, such as creating pipeline variables.


        This scope does not implicitly grant the `read:pipeline:bitbucket` or
        the `write:pipeline:bitbucket` scopes.


        #### read:runner:bitbucket

        Allows viewing of runners information.


        #### write:runner:bitbucket

        Allows runners management.


        This scope does not imply the `read:runners:bitbucket` scope.

      body: "\nYou can query the 2.0 API for specific objects using a simple language which resembles SQL.\n\nNote that filtering and querying by username has been deprecated, due to privacy changes. \nSee the [announcement](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/#changes-to-querying) \nfor details.\n\n\n\n* [Supported endpoints](#supported-endpoints)\n* [Operators](#operators)\n* [Data types](#data-types)\n* [Querying](#querying)\n* [Sorting query results](#sorting-query-results)\n\n-\n\n### Supported endpoints\n\nMost 2.0 API resources that return paginated collections of objects support a single, shared, generic querying language that is used to filter down a result set.\n\nThis includes, but is in no way limited to:\n\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/branches\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/forks\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/src\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/issues\n    /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests\n\nFiltering and sorting supports several distinct operators and data types as well as basic features, like logical operators (AND, OR).\nAs examples, the following queries could be used on the issue tracker endpoint (`/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/issues/`):\n\n\t(state = \"open\" OR state = \"new\") AND assignee = null\n\treporter.nickname != \"evzijst\" AND priority >= \"major\"\n\t(title  \"unicode\" OR content.raw  \"unicode\") AND created_on > 2015-10-04T14:00:00-07:00\n\nFilter queries can be added to the URL using the q=<query> query parameter. To sort the response, add sort=<field>. Note that the entire query string is put in the q parameter and hence needs to be URL-encoded as shown in the following example:\n\n\t/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state=\"new\"&sort=-updated_on\n\n\n### Operators\n\nFiltering and sorting supports the following operators:\n\n| Operator | Definition                     | Example                    |\n|-|--|-|\n| \"=\"      | test for equality              | `nickname = \"evzijst\"`     |\n| \"!=\"     | not equal                      | `is_private != true`       |\n| \"\"      | case-insensitive text contains | `description  \"beef\"`     |\n| \"!\"     | case-insensitive not contains  | `description ! \"fubar\"`   |\n| \">\"      | greater than                   | `priority > \"major\"`       |\n| \">=\"     | greater than or equal          | `priority <= \"trivial\"`    |\n| \"<\"      | less than                      | `id < 1234`                |\n| \"<=\"     | less than or equal             | `updated_on <= 2015-03-04` |\n\n### Data types\n\nFiltering and sorting supports the following data types:\n\n| Type         | Description                             | Example       |\n|--|--||\n| **String**   | any text inside double quotes           | `\"foo\"`       |\n| **Number**   | arbitrary precision integers and floats | `1, -10.302`  |\n| **Null**     | to test for the absence of a value      | `null`        |\n| **boolean**  | the unquoted strings true or false      | `true, false` |\n| **datetime** | an unquoted [ISO-8601][iso-8601] date time string with the timezone offset, milliseconds and entire time component being optional | `2015-03-04T14:08:59.123+02:00`, `2015-03-04T14:08:59` Date time strings are assumed to be in UTC, unless an explicit timezone offset is provided |\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601]: /iso-8601\n\n### Querying\n\nObjects can be filtered based on their properties. In principle, every element in an object's JSON document schema can be used as a filter criterion.\n\nNote that while the array of objects in a paginated response is wrapped in an\nenvelope with a `values` element, this prefix should not be included in the\nquery fields (so use `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state=\"new\"`, not\n`/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=values.state=\"new\"`).\n\n\n### Examples\n\nFields that contain embedded instances of other object types (e.g. owner is an embedded user object, while parent is an embedded repository) can be traversed recursively. For instance:\n\n\tparent.owner.nickname = \"bitbucket\"\n\nTo find pull requests which merge into master, come from a fork of the repo rather than a branch inside the repo, and on which I am a reviewer:\n\n```\nsource.repository.full_name != \"main/repo\" AND state = \"OPEN\" AND reviewers.nickname = \"evzijst\" AND destination.branch.name = \"master\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/main/repo/pullrequests?q=source.repository.full_name+%21%3D+%22main%2Frepo%22+AND+state+%3D+%22OPEN%22+AND+reviewers.nickname+%3D+%22evzijst%22+AND+destination.branch.name+%3D+%22master%22\n```\n\nTo find new or on-hold issues related to the UI, created or updated in the last day (SF local time), that have not yet been assigned to anyone:\n\n```\n(state = \"new\" OR state = \"on hold\") AND assignee = null AND component = \"UI\" and updated_on > 2015-11-11T00:00:00-07:00\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/main/repo/issues?q=%28state+%3D+%22new%22+OR+state+%3D+%22on+hold%22%29+AND+assignee+%3D+null+AND+component+%3D+%22UI%22+and+updated_on+%3E+2015-11-11T00%3A00%3A00-07%3A00\n```\n\nTo find all tags with the string \"2015\" in the name:\n\n```\nname  \"2015\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags?q=name+%7E+%222015%22\n```\nOr all my branches:\n\n```\nname  \"erik/\"\n```\n```\n/2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/?q=name+%7E+%22erik%2F%22\n```\n### Sorting query results\n\nYou can sort result sets using the ?sort=<field> query parameter, available on the same resources that support filtering:\n\n* In principle, every field that can be queried can also be used as a key for sorting.\n* By default the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, prefix the field name with a hyphen (e.g. ?sort=-updated_on).\n* Only one field can be sorted on. Compound fields (e.g. sort on state first, followed by updated_on) are not supported.\n\n\n"

      body: >

        Endpoints that return collections of objects should always apply
        pagination.

        Paginated collections are always wrapped in the following wrapper
        object:


        ```json

        {
          "size": 5421,
          "page": 2,
          "pagelen": 10,
          "next": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=3",
          "previous": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=1",
          "values": [
            ...
          ]
        }

        ```


        Pagination is often page-bound, with a query parameter page indicating
        which

        page is to be returned.


        However, clients are not expected to construct URLs themselves by
        manipulating

        the page number query parameter. Instead, the response contains a link
        to the

        next page. This link should be treated as an opaque location that is not
        to be

        constructed by clients or even assumed to be predictable. The only
        contract

        around the next link is that it will return the next chunk of results.


        Lack of a next link in the response indicates the end of the collection.


        The paginated response contains the following fields:


        | Field      | Value    |

        ||-|

        | `size`     | Total number of objects in the response. This is an
        optional element that is not provided in all responses, as it can be
        expensive to compute. |

        | `page`     | Page number of the current results. This is an optional
        element that is not provided in all responses. |

        | `pagelen`  | Current number of objects on the existing page. Globally,
        the minimum length is 10 and the maximum is 100. Some APIs may specify a
        different default. |

        | `next`     | Link to the next page if it exists. The last page of a
        collection does not have this value. Use this link to navigate the
        result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs. |

        | `previous` | Link to previous page if it exists. A collections first
        page does not have this value. This is an optional element that is not
        provided in all responses. Some result sets strictly support forward
        navigation and never provide previous links. Clients must anticipate
        that backwards navigation is not always available. Use this link to
        navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs. |

        | `values`   | The list of objects. This contains at most `pagelen`
        objects. |


        The link to the next page is included such that you don't have to
        hardcode or construct any links.  Only values and next are guaranteed
        (except the last page, which lacks next). This is because the previous
        and size values can be expensive for some data sets.


        It is important to realize that Bitbucket support both list-based
        pagination and iterator-based pagination. List-based pagination assumes
        that the collection is a discrete, immutable, consistently ordered,
        finite array of objects with a fixed size. Clients navigate a list-based
        collection by requesting offset-based chunks. In Bitbucket Cloud,
        list-based responses include the optional size, page, and previous
        element. The the next and previous links typically resemble something
        like /foo/bar?page=4.


        However, not all result sets can be treated as immutable and finite 
        much like how programming languages tend to distinguish between lists
        and arrays on one hand and iterators or stream on the other. Where an
        list-based pagination offers random access into any point in a
        collection, iterator-based pagination can only navigate forward one
        element at a time. In Bitbucket such iterator-based pagination contains
        the next link and pagelen elements, but not necessarily anything else.
        In these cases, the next link's value often contains an unpredictable
        hash instead of an explicit page number. The commits resource uses
        iterator-based pagination.

        By default, each endpoint returns the full representation of a resource
        and in

        some cases that can be a lot of data. For example, retrieving a list of
        pull

        requests can amount to quite a large document.


        For better performance, you can ask the server to only return the fields
        you

        really need and to omit unwanted data. To request a partial response and
        to

        add or remove specific fields from a response, use the `fields` query

        parameter.



        ### Example


        Most API resources embed a substantial list of links pointing to related

        resources. This saves the client from constructing its own URLs, but is

        somewhat wasteful when the client doesn't need them.


        To significantly reduce the size of the response, use `?fields=-links`:


        ```json

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links

        {
          "nickname": "evzijst",
          "account_status": "active",
          "website": "",
          "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
          "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
          "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
          "location": null,
          "type": "user"
        }

        ```


        ### Fields parameter syntax


        The `fields` parameter supports 3 modes of operation:


        1. Removal of select fields (e.g. `-links`)

        2. Pulling in additional fields not normally returned by an endpoint,
        while
           still getting all the default fields (e.g. `+reviewers`)
        3. Omitting all fields, except those specified (e.g.
        `owner.display_name`)


        The fields parameter can contain a list of multiple comma-separated
        field names

        (e.g. `fields=owner.display_name,uuid,links.self.href`). The parameter
        itself is

        not repeated.


        As discussed at [Condensed Versus Full
        Objects](serialization#representations),

        most objects that are embedded inside other objects (like how `owner` is
        an

        embedded `user` object in `repository`) appear in "condensed" form that
        omits

        many fields. The `fields` parameter allows us to pull in additional
        fields in

        such cases.


        For example, the embedded repository object in a pull request does not
        normally

        contain its `owner`. To add that in we can use:

        `+values.destination.repository.owner`.



        ### Wildcards


        The asterisk can be used to match all fields on a particular level. For

        example, removing all entries from the `links` element can be done like
        this:


        ```json

        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links.*

        {
          "nickname": "evzijst",
          "account_status": "active",
          "website": "",
          "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
          "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
          "links": {},
          "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
          "location": null,
          "type": "user"
        }

        ```


        Wildcards can be used in combination with exclusion and inclusion. For

        instance, `-*,+foo,+bar` will remove all elements from the root level
        and then

        add in `foo` and `bar`.



        ### URL encoding


        Be aware that when using the `+foo.bar` syntax in the query string, that
        the

        "+" must be URL encoded as "%2B" and so the URL will be:


        ```

        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/interruptingcow?fields=%2Bowner.created_on

        ```


        Without URL escaping, "+" is interpreted as an encoded space which will
        not

        match any fields.



        ### Field discovery


        While a resource's `self` URL, as well its "collection" URL typically
        return

        the full object with all its fields, there are some exceptions for
        fields that

        are overly verbose or costly to generate.


        For instance, a pull request contains the embedded lists of reviewers
        and

        participants. These fields are included from the `self` URL, but not
        from the

        `/pullrequests` collections resource, as it would impact performance too
        much.


        To discover any additional fields that might not be included by default,

        `fields=*` can be used.



        ### More examples


        If we want to get a list of all reviewer nicknames on pull requests I
        created,

        we could combine a [filter](filtering) with a partial response. This
        will omit

        all other data from the response:


        ```

        /2.0/repositories/bitbucket/bitbucket/pullrequests?fields=values.id,values.reviewers.nickname,values.state&q=author.uuid%3D%22%7Bd301aafa-d676-4ee0-88be-962be7417567%7D%22

        ### Open API Specification


        Bitbucket uses the [Open API Specification](https://openapis.org) (OAI,

        formerly known as Swagger) to describe its APIs. Our OAI specification
        schema

        is hosted at
        [https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json](https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json)

        and serves as the canonical definition and comprehensive declaration of
        all

        available endpoints.


        The OAI specification makes writing client applications easier by:

        auto-generating boilerplate code (like data object classes) and dealing
        with

        authentication and error handling.


        You can find a comprehensive set of open tools for the OAI specification
        at:

        [https://github.com/swagger-api](https://github.com/swagger-api).



        ### JSON Schema


        Bitbucket uses JSON Schema to describe the layout of every type of
        object

        consumed or produced by the API. These schemas are collected under the

        `#definitions` element of our swagger.json file.


        When an endpoint expects an object as part of a POST or PUT, it also
        expects

        the object to validate against the JSON schemas. The same applies to
        objects

        returned by an endpoint.



        ### Condensed Versus Full Objects


        Most objects in Bitbucket come both in "full" and "partial"
        representation.

        The full representation is when all elements are included. This is the
        layout

        returned by a resource's `self` location (e.g.
        `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar`),

        as well as resource collection endpoints (e.g. `/2.0/repositories`).


        However, Bitbucket objects often embed other objects. For example, a
        `repository`

        object embeds a `user` object for its owner. Likewise, a `pullrequest`
        object

        embeds its `repository` object.


        These related objects are embedded, or inlined, to reduce the "chatter"
        when

        clients make frequent followup API calls to collect information on
        common,

        related information.


        Embedded related objects are typically limited in their fields to avoid
        such

        object graphs from becoming too deep and noisy. They often exclude their
        own

        nested objects in an attempt to strike a balance between performance and

        utility.


        An object's embedded or condensed representation tends to be
        standardized,

        meaning the fields included is the same set, regardless of where the
        object

        was embedded.

        You should be familiar with REST architecture before writing an
        integration. Read this overview page to gain a good understanding of
        Bitbucket's REST implementation.

        ### URI structure


        All Bitbucket Cloud requests start with the
        `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0` prefix (for the 2.0 API) and
        `https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0` prefix (1.0 API).


        The next segment of the URI path depends on the endpoint of the request.
        For example, using the curl command and the repositories endpoint you
        can list all the issues on Bitbucket's tutorial repository:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org

        ```

        Given a specific endpoint, you can then drill down to a particular
        aspect or resource of that endpoint. The issues resource on a repository
        is an example:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org/issues

        ```


        #### HTTP methods


        A given endpoint or resource has a series of actions (or methods)
        associated with it. The Bitbucket service supports these standard HTTP
        methods:


        | Call | Description |

        ||-|

        | GET    | Retrieves information. |

        | PUT    | Updates existing information. |

        | POST   | Creates new information. |

        | DELETE | Removes existing information. |


        For example, you can call use the POST action on the issues resource and
        create an issue on the issue tracker.


        **Specifying content length**


        You can get a `411 Length Required` response. If this happens, the API
        requires a Content-Length header but the client is not sending it. You
        should add the header yourself, for example using the curl client:


        ```

        curl -r PUT --header "Content-Length: 0" -u user:app_password
        https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/emails/rap@atlassian.com

        ```


        ### Universally Unique Identifier


        UUID's provide a single point of recognition for users, teams, and
        repositories. The UUID is distinct from the username, team name, and
        repository name fields and remains the same even when those fields
        change. For example when a user changes their username or moves a
        repository you will need to modify calls which use those identifiers but
        not if you are pointing to the UUID.


        #### UUID examples and structure


        UUID's work with both the 1.0 and 2.0 APIs for the user, team, and
        repository objects. The following examples the following characters are
        replacements for curly brackets: `%7B` replaces `{`  and `%7D` replaces
        `}`. You will see this structure in the following example sections.


        #### User object and UUID


        When you make a call using either the username or the UUID for that user
        the response is the same.


        **Call with username**:


        ```

        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials

        ```


        ***Call with UUID for the user**:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bc788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007%7D

        ```

            "type": "user"
        }

        ```


        #### Repository object and UUID


        Once you have the UUID for a repository you no longer need a username or
        team name to make the API call so long as you use an empty field. This
        helps you resolve repositories no matter if the username or team name
        changes.


        **Call with team name (1team) and repository name (moxie)**:


        ```

        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie

        ```

        **Call with UUID and empty field**:


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/%7B%7D/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D

        ```


        **Call with UUID and teamname**:

        #### Team object and UUID


        This example shows a call for a list of team members using both the team
        name and with the UUID for the team object. As the call is
        unauthenticated in the following example the response object will only
        show members with public profiles. The response is the same in either
        case.


        **Call with teamname**


        ```

        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/1team/members

        ```

        **Call with UUID for team object**


        ```

        curl
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/%7Baa559944-83c9-4963-a9a8-69ac8d9cf5d2%7D/members

        ### Standardized error responses


        The 2.0 API standardizes the error response layout. The 2.0 API serves a
        JSON

        object along with the appropriate HTTP status code. The JSON object
        provides a

        detailed  problem description.


        ```json

        {
            "type": "error",
            "error": {
                "message": "Bad request",
                "fields": {
                    "src": [
                        "This field is required."
                    ]
                },
                "detail": "You must specify a valid source branch when creating a pull request.",
                "id": "d23a1cc5178f7637f3d9bf2d13824258",
                "data": {
                  "extra": "Optional, endpoint-specific data to further augment the error."
                }
            }
        }

        ```


        This object contains an error element which contains the following
        nested

        elements:


        | Element | Description |

        ||-|

        | message | A short description of the problem. This element is always
        present. Its value may be localized. |

        | fields  | This optional element is used in response to POST or PUT
        operations in which clients have provided invalid input. It contains a
        list of one or more client-provided fields that failed validation. The
        values may be localized. |

        | detail  | An optional detailed explanation of the failure. Its value
        may be localized.

        | id      | An optional unique error identifier that identifies the
        error in Bitbucket's logging system. If you feel you hit a bug in an API
        and this field is provided, please mention it if you decide to contact
        support as it will greatly help us narrow down the problem. |


        ### Standard ISO-8601 timestamps


        All 2.0 APIs use standardized ISO-8601 timestamps. In most cases, our
        APIs return UTC timestamps and for these, the timezone offset part will
        be 00:00. In rare cases where the original localized timestamp has
        significance, the timezone offset may identify the event's original
        timezone.

        ### Cors


        The Bitbucket API supports Cross-origin resource sharing to allow
        requests for restricted resources across domains. For more information
        you can refer to:


        * [Wikipedia article on
        CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)

        * [W3C CORS recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)


        Sending a general request from the api to bitbucket.com:


        `curl -i https://api.bitbucket.org -H "origin: http://bitbucket.com"`


        Gives this result:

        ### Supported content types


        The default and primary content type for 2.0 APIs is JSON. This applies
        both to responses from the server and to the request bodies provided by
        the client.


        Unless documented otherwise, whenever creating a new (POST) or modifying
        an existing (PUT) object, your client must provide the object's normal
        representation. Not every object element can be mutated. For example, a
        repository's created_on date is an auto-generated, immutable field. Your
        client can omit immutable fields from a request body.


        In some cases, a resource might also accept regular
        application/x-www-url-form-encoded POST and PUT bodies. Such bodies can
        be more convenient in scripts and command line usage. Requests bodies
        can contain contain nested elements or they can be flat (without nested
        elements). Clients can send flat request bodies as either as
        application/json or as application/x-www-url-form-encoded. Nested
        objects always require JSON.


        ### Resource links


        Every 2.0 object contains a links element that points to related
        resources or alternate representations. Use links to quickly discover
        and traverse to related objects. Links serve a "self-documenting"
        function for each endpoint. For example, the following request for a
        specific user:



        `$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials`


        ```json

        {
            "username": "tutorials",
            "nickname": "tutorials",
            "account_status": "active",
            "website": "https://tutorials.bitbucket.org/",
            "display_name": "tutorials account",
            "uuid": "{c788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007}",
            "links": {
                "self": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials"
                },
                "repositories": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials"
                },
                "html": {
                    "href": "https://bitbucket.org/tutorials"
                },
                "followers": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/followers"
                },
                "avatar": {
                    "href": "https://bitbucket-assetroot.s3.amazonaws.com/c/photos/2013/Nov/25/tutorials-avatar-1563784409-6_avatar.png"
                },
                "following": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/following"
                }
            },
            "created_on": "2011-12-20T16:34:07.132459+00:00",
            "location": "Santa Monica, CA",
            "type": "user"
        }

        ```

        Links can be actual REST API resources or they can be informational. In
        this example, informative resources include the user's avatar and the
        HTML URL for the user's Bitbucket account. Your client should avoid
        hardcoding an API's URL and instead use the URLs returned in API
        responses.


        A link's key is its `rel` (relationship) attribute and it contains a
        mandatory href element. For example, the following link:


        ```json

        "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials"
        }

        ```


        The rel for this link is self and the href is
        https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials. A single rel key can
        contain an list (array) of href objects. Your client should anticipate
        that any rel key can contain one or more href objects.


        Finally, links can also contain optional elements. Two common optional
        elements are the name element and the title element. They are often used
        to disambiguate links that share the same rel key. In the example below,
        the repository object that contains a clone link with two href objects.
        Each object contains the optional name element to clarify its use.


        ```json

        "links": {
          "self": {
            "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/bitbucket"
          },
          "clone": [
            {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/evzijst/bitbucket.git",
              "name": "https"
            },
            {
              "href": "ssh://git@bitbucket.org/erik/bitbucket.git",
              "name": "ssh"
            }
          ],
          ...
        }

        ```

        Links can support [URI Templates](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570);
        Those that do contain a `"templated": "true"` element.

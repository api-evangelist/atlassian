  title: Atlassian Confluence Content API
  description: >-
    Atlassian Confluence Content API is a tool that allows users to access and
    manipulate content within the Confluence platform programmatically. The API
    enables developers to create, update, and delete pages, blog posts,
    comments, attachments, and more within Confluence. This provides a way for
    organizations to automate processes, integrate Confluence with other tools
    and systems, and customize their content management workflows.

      summary: Archive Pages
      description: >-
        Archives one or more pages in Confluence, which removes them from normal
        view and search results while preserving the content for potential
        future restoration. This operation requires appropriate permissions and
        accepts a list of page IDs to be archived simultaneously. When pages are
        archived, they become inaccessible to most users but can be managed by
        administrators through the archive interface. The operation helps
        maintain workspace organization by allowing teams to hide outdated or
        irrelevant content without permanently deleting it, supporting content
        lifecycle management and compliance requirements while maintaining the
        ability to recover information if needed.

      summary: Publish Shared Draft
      description: >-
        This API operation publishes a shared draft blueprint in Atlassian
        Confluence by sending a PUT request to the specified endpoint with the
        draft's unique identifier. When invoked, it converts a collaborative
        draft that multiple users may have been working on into a published
        Confluence page, making it visible according to the space's permissions.
        The operation requires the draft ID as a path parameter and typically
        accepts additional parameters in the request body to specify publication
        details such as the target space, page title, and any content
        modifications. This is commonly used in workflows where teams
        collaborate on content in draft form before officially publishing it to
        their Confluence space.

        The Publish Legacy Draft endpoint is a POST operation in the Atlassian
        Confluence Content API that allows users to convert a draft blueprint
        into published content. By making a request to
        /wiki/rest/api/content/blueprint/instance/{draftId}, where {draftId} is
        the unique identifier of the draft to be published, users can finalize
        and make visible content that was previously in draft state. This
        endpoint is particularly useful for workflows where content is first
        created as a draft from a blueprint template and then needs to be
        formally published to make it accessible to other Confluence users. The
        operation transforms the draft state into a permanent page or blog post
        within the Confluence space, completing the content creation process
        that began with the blueprint draft.

        This API operation allows you to search for Confluence content using the
        Confluence Query Language (CQL), providing a powerful and flexible way
        to retrieve pages, blog posts, attachments, and other content types
        based on specific criteria. By sending a GET request to the
        /wiki/rest/api/content/search endpoint with a CQL query string
        parameter, you can filter content by various attributes such as type,
        space, creator, creation date, labels, title text, or any combination of
        these conditions. The operation returns a paginated list of content
        objects matching your search criteria, including metadata like content
        IDs, titles, types, and links, making it useful for building custom
        dashboards, reports, or integrations that need to locate and retrieve

        This API operation updates an existing piece of content in Atlassian
        Confluence by sending a PUT request to the specified content ID

        title, body, version number, and metadata of pages, blog posts, or other
        content types within your Confluence instance. The operation requires
        you to provide the complete updated content object in the request body,
        including mandatory fields like version information to ensure proper
        conflict handling and version tracking. You must have appropriate
        permissions to edit the content, and the version number must be
        incremented from the current version to successfully complete the
        update. This operation is commonly used for programmatically editing
        wiki pages, updating documentation, or integrating Confluence content
        management into automated workflows.

        Deletes a piece of content from Confluence by specifying its unique

        removes the content item, which can include pages, blog posts, comments,
        or attachments, from the Confluence space. The deletion is typically
        irreversible through the API, though Confluence may retain the content
        in trash for a limited time depending on instance configuration. This
        endpoint requires appropriate permissions, as users must have delete
        rights for the specific content being removed. The operation accepts the

        This API operation moves a Confluence page to a new location in the

        moved, the position parameter that specifies where to place it (such as
        'before' or 'after'), and the targetId of the reference page that
        determines the new location. By sending a PUT request to this endpoint,
        users can programmatically reorganize their Confluence space structure,
        moving pages to appear before or after other pages in the page tree,
        which is particularly useful for maintaining documentation hierarchies
        or restructuring content organization without manual intervention
        through the Confluence UI.

        This operation retrieves all attachments that are children of a specific
        Confluence content page identified by its ID. It returns a paginated
        list of attachment objects associated with the given content, where each
        attachment contains metadata such as filename, media type, file size,
        download URL, and version information. The response can be filtered and
        expanded using optional query parameters to include additional details
        like attachment history, version information, or container details. This
        endpoint is useful for discovering what files are attached to a
        particular Confluence page and accessing their properties without having
        to download the actual file content.

      description: >-
        This API operation allows you to create a new attachment or update an
        existing attachment for a specific Confluence page or blog post
        identified by its content ID. When uploading a file, you must use
        multipart/form-data encoding and include the file in the request body
        along with optional metadata such as comments or minor edit flags. If an
        attachment with the same filename already exists, this operation will
        create a new version of that attachment rather than replacing it
        entirely, maintaining the version history. The operation requires
        appropriate permissions on the parent content and returns detailed
        information about the created or updated attachment, including its
        download URL, file size, media type, and version number. This is
        particularly useful for programmatically managing documentation assets,
        images, or any supplementary files associated with Confluence content.

        The Update Attachment Properties operation in the Atlassian Confluence
        Content API allows you to modify the metadata and properties of an
        existing attachment within a Confluence page or blog post. Using a PUT
        request to the endpoint
        /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}/child/attachment/{attachmentId}, you can
        update attributes such as the attachment's title, version information,
        and other custom properties without having to re-upload the actual file.
        This operation requires you to specify both the parent content ID and
        the specific attachment ID in the URL path, and you must provide the
        updated property data in the request body, typically in JSON format. The
        operation is useful for maintaining attachment metadata, correcting
        filenames, or updating attachment descriptions while preserving the
        original file content and its position within the content hierarchy.

        Updates the binary data of an existing attachment in Confluence by

        operation requires the attachment ID and content ID as path parameters,
        and the new file data must be sent as multipart/form-data in the request
        body. The endpoint maintains the attachment's metadata such as title and
        file extension while replacing only the actual file content. Upon
        successful update, it returns the updated attachment object with new
        version information, file size, and modification timestamp. This is
        useful for scenarios where you need to revise documents, images, or
        other files attached to Confluence pages without creating a new
        attachment entry.

      description: >-
        This API operation retrieves the body content of a specific macro
        embedded within a particular version of a Confluence page and
        asynchronously converts it to a different representation format. By
        providing the content ID, version number, macro ID, and target format,
        the endpoint initiates a conversion process that runs in the background,
        allowing you to transform macro content between different supported
        representations (such as storage, view, or export formats) without
        blocking the request. This is particularly useful for handling large or
        complex macro content where synchronous conversion might timeout, and
        the asynchronous nature enables better performance and scalability when
        processing multiple conversion requests or dealing with
        resource-intensive transformations.

        This API operation retrieves all labels that have been applied to a
        specific piece of Confluence content identified by its unique ID. When
        you make a GET request to this endpoint, it returns a collection of
        labels associated with the specified content, which can include both
        user-created labels and system-generated ones. Labels in Confluence are
        used for categorization, organization, and searchability of content such
        as pages, blog posts, and attachments. The response typically includes
        details about each label such as its name, prefix (if applicable), and
        ID, allowing developers to programmatically access and manage the
        tagging metadata of content within a Confluence space.

            - `global` prefix is used by default when a user adds a label

            via the UI.

            - `my` prefix can be explicitly added by a user when adding a label

            via the UI, e.g. 'my:example-label'. Also, when a page is selected
            as

            a favourite, the 'my:favourite' label is automatically added.

            - `team` can used when adding labels via [Add labels to
            content](#api-content-id-label-post)

            but is not used in the UI.

      description: >-
        This API operation allows you to add one or more labels to a specific
        piece of Confluence content by making a POST request to the endpoint
        with the content's unique identifier. Labels are metadata tags that help
        organize, categorize, and improve the discoverability of pages, blog
        posts, and other content within Confluence. When calling this endpoint,
        you must provide the content ID in the URL path and include an array of
        label objects in the request body, specifying properties such as the
        label prefix (typically 'global') and the label name. The operation
        requires appropriate permissions to modify the target content, and upon
        successful execution, it returns the newly added labels along with their
        metadata. This functionality is commonly used for bulk tagging
        operations, automated content categorization workflows, or integrating
        external systems that need to apply consistent labeling schemes across
        Confluence spaces.

      summary: Copy Page Hierarchy
      description: >-
        This API operation allows you to copy an entire page hierarchy from one
        location in Confluence to another. By making a POST request to this
        endpoint with a specific page ID, you can duplicate not only the parent
        page but also all of its child pages and their descendants, preserving
        the hierarchical structure. This is useful when you need to replicate a
        complete documentation structure, create templates from existing page
        trees, or reorganize content while maintaining the original hierarchy.
        The operation requires appropriate permissions and will copy all
        associated content, including page bodies, attachments, and nested child
        pages to the specified destination within your Confluence space.

      summary: Copy Single Page
      description: >-
        The Copy Single Page operation in the Atlassian Confluence Content API
        allows users to duplicate an existing page by sending a POST request to
        /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}/copy, where {id} represents the unique
        identifier of the source page to be copied. This endpoint creates a new
        page with the same content, formatting, and attachments as the original,
        though the copy will have a new page ID and can be placed in a different
        location within the Confluence space. The request typically requires
        authentication and appropriate permissions to copy content, and you can
        optionally specify parameters such as the destination space, parent
        page, and title for the new copy. The API returns details about the
        newly created page including its ID, title, and location, making it
        useful for content duplication workflows, template creation, or
        migrating pages within or across Confluence spaces.

        Updates an existing content property in Atlassian Confluence by
        replacing its value with new data. This PUT endpoint requires both the
        content ID and property key to be specified in the URL path, allowing
        you to modify custom metadata or additional attributes attached to a
        specific piece of content such as a page, blog post, or attachment. The
        request body must contain the new property value along with its version
        number to ensure proper conflict handling and maintain data integrity.
        This operation is useful for storing application-specific data, custom
        attributes, or metadata alongside Confluence content without modifying
        the content itself, and it returns the updated property information upon
        successful completion.

        The Add Restrictions operation in the Atlassian Confluence Content API
        allows you to apply access controls to a specific piece of content by
        sending a POST request to /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}/restriction, where
        {id} represents the unique identifier of the content you want to
        restrict. This endpoint enables administrators and authorized users to
        define who can view or edit the content by specifying user accounts,
        groups, or both in the request payload. The restrictions can be applied
        at different operation levels such as read or update permissions,
        effectively controlling content visibility and editability within a
        Confluence space. When successfully executed, the API returns the newly
        created restriction details, allowing you to implement fine-grained
        security policies and maintain proper content governance across your
        Confluence instance.

        The Atlassian Confluence Content API endpoint

        using the GET method retrieves the restriction status for a specific

        administrators and authorized users to check whether a designated group
        has restrictions applied for a specific operation (such as read or
        update) on content identified by its unique ID. The endpoint requires
        three path parameters: the content ID, the operation key that defines
        the type of action being restricted, and the group name for which to
        check restrictions. The response returns details about whether the
        specified group is restricted from performing the given operation on the
        content, helping manage fine-grained access control within Confluence
        spaces and pages.

      description: >-
        The PUT operation on the Atlassian Confluence Content API endpoint
        `/wiki/rest/api/content/{id}/restriction/byOperation/{operationKey}/group/{groupName}`
        adds a specified group to an existing content restriction for a
        particular operation type. This allows administrators to grant a group
        access to perform specific operations (such as read, update, or delete)
        on restricted Confluence content by including the group in the
        restriction's allowed list. The endpoint requires three path parameters:
        the content ID identifying the specific page or blog post, the operation
        key specifying the type of operation being restricted (like 'read' or
        'update'), and the group name identifying which user group should be
        granted access. This operation is essential for managing collaborative
        permissions and implementing fine-grained access control within
        Confluence spaces, enabling teams to secure sensitive content while
        selectively allowing specific groups to interact with it based on their
        operational needs.

      summary: Add User To Content Restriction
      description: >-
        Updates content restrictions by adding a user to a specific
        operation-based restriction on a Confluence content item. This endpoint
        allows administrators to grant a particular user permission to perform a
        specified operation (such as 'read' or 'update') on restricted content
        by adding them to the allowlist for that operation. The request requires
        the content ID, the operation key (the type of restriction being
        modified), and the user details to be added. This is useful for managing
        granular access control on individual pages or blog posts when you need
        to give specific users access to restricted content without changing the
        broader space or content permissions.

      description: >-
        This API operation removes a specific user from content restrictions for
        a given operation type in Atlassian Confluence. By making a DELETE
        request to the endpoint with the content ID, operation key (such as
        'read' or 'update'), and user account ID as parameters, administrators
        can revoke previously granted or denied permissions for that user on the
        specified content. This is useful for managing access control when a
        user's permissions need to be changed or when cleaning up outdated
        restrictions, effectively removing the user from the restriction list
        without affecting other users' permissions on the same content.

        This API operation allows you to set or update the content state of a
        specific Confluence page or blog post by its ID, which triggers the
        creation and publication of a new version of that content. When invoked

        parameter and the desired state information in the request body, then
        applies that state to the content item while automatically incrementing
        its version number. This is particularly useful for implementing
        workflow states, approval processes, or status tracking within
        Confluence content, as it not only changes the state metadata but also
        ensures the change is captured as a new version in the content's

      description: >-
        The Restore Content Version operation is a POST request to the Atlassian
        Confluence Content API endpoint /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}/version that
        allows you to restore a previously saved version of a specific piece of
        content by its ID. This operation takes the content ID as a path
        parameter and requires authentication with appropriate permissions to
        modify the content. When executed, it reverts the current content back
        to a specified historical version, effectively making that older version
        the new current version while preserving the version history. This is
        useful for recovering from unwanted changes, reverting edits, or rolling
        back content to a known good state. The operation requires the version
        number to be specified in the request body and returns the restored
        content object with updated version information upon successful
        completion.

      description: >-
        A multi-value parameter indicating which properties of the content to
        expand and populate. Expands are dependent on the

        `to` conversion format and may be irrelevant for certain conversions
        (e.g. `macroRenderedOutput` is redundant when

        converting to `view` format). 


        If rendering to `view` format, and the body content being converted
        includes arbitrary nested content (such as macros); then it is 

        necessary to include webresource expands in the request. Webresources
        for content body are the batched JS and CSS dependencies for

        any nested dynamic content (i.e. macros).


        - `embeddedContent` returns metadata for nested content (e.g. page
        included using page include macro)

        - `mediaToken` returns JWT token for retrieving attachment data from
        Media API

        - `macroRenderedOutput` additionally converts body to view format

        - `webresource.superbatch.uris.js` returns all common JS dependencies as
        static URLs

        - `webresource.superbatch.uris.css` returns all common CSS dependencies
        as static URLs

        - `webresource.superbatch.uris.all` returns all common dependencies as
        static URLs

        - `webresource.superbatch.tags.all` returns all common JS dependencies
        as html `<script>` tags

        - `webresource.superbatch.tags.css` returns all common CSS dependencies
        as html `<style>` tags

        - `webresource.superbatch.tags.js` returns all common dependencies as
        html `<script>` and `<style>` tags

        - `webresource.uris.js` returns JS dependencies specific to conversion

        - `webresource.uris.css` returns CSS dependencies specific to conversion

        - `webresource.uris.all` returns all dependencies specific to
        conversion     

        - `webresource.tags.all` returns common JS dependencies as html
        `<script>` tags

    - title: About
      anchor: about
      body: >-
        This is the reference for the Confluence Cloud REST API. This API is the
        primary way to get and

        modify data in Confluence Cloud, whether you are developing an app or
        any other integration.

        Use it to interact with Confluence entities, like pages and blog posts,
        spaces, users, groups,

        and more.
    - title: Authentication and authorization
      anchor: auth
      body: >-
        **Authentication:** If you are building a Cloud app, authentication is
        implemented via JWT or OAuth 2.0, depending on what you are building
        (see [Security
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)).
        Otherwise, if you are authenticating directly against the REST API, the
        REST API supports basic auth (see [Basic auth for REST
        APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)).


        **Authorization:** If you are building a Cloud app, authorization can be
        implemented by
        [scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/scopes/) or by
        [OAuth 2.0 user
        impersonation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-jwt-bearer-tokens-for-apps).
        Otherwise, if you are making calls directly against the REST API,
        authorization is based on the user used in the authentication process.


        See [Security
        overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/)
        for more details on authentication and authorization.
    - title: Status codes
      anchor: status-code
      body: >-
        The Confluence REST API uses the [standard HTTP status
        codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).


        Responses that return an error status code will also return a response
        body, similar to the following:

        ```json

        {
          "statusCode": 404,
          "data": {
            "authorized": false,
            "valid": false,
            "errors": [
              {
                "message": {
                  "translation": "This is an example error message.",
                  "args": []
                }
              }
            ],
            "successful": false
          },
          "message": "This is an example error message."
        }

        ```
    - title: Using the REST API
      anchor: using
      body: >-
        **Expansion:** The Confluence REST API uses resource expansion: some
        parts of a resource are not returned unless explicitly specified. This
        simplifies responses and minimizes network traffic.


        To expand part of a resource in a request, use the `expand` query
        parameter and specify the entities to be expanded. If you need to expand
        nested entities, use the `.` dot notation. For example, the following
        request will expand information about the requested content's space and
        labels:

        ```

        GET /wiki/rest/api/content/{id}?expand=space,metadata.labels

        ```

        **Pagination:** The Confluence REST API uses pagination: a method that
        returns a response with multiple objects can only return a limited
        number at one time. This limits the size of responses and conserves
        server resources.


        Use the 'limit' and 'start' query parameters to specify pagination:


        - `limit` is the number of objects to return per page. This may be
        restricted by system limits.

        - `start` is the index of the first item returned in the page of
        results. The base index is 0.


        For example, the following request will return ten content objects,
        starting from the fifth object.

        ```

        GET /wiki/rest/api/content?start=4&limit=10

        ```

        **Special headers:**


        - `X-Atlassian-Token: no-check` request header must be specified for
        methods

        that are protected from Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF/CSRF) attacks.
        This is

        stated in the method description, if required. For more information, see
        this

        [KB
        article](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloudkb/xsrf-check-failed-when-calling-cloud-apis-826874382.html).
    - title: Capabilities
      anchor: capabilities
      body: >-
        **Webhooks:** A webhook is a user-defined callback over HTTP. You can
        use Confluence webhooks to notify your app or web application when
        certain events occur in Confluence. For example, when a page is created
        or updated. To learn more, see
        [Webhooks](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/modules/webhook/).


        **Content properties:** Content properties are a key-value storage
        associated with a piece of Confluence content. If you are building an
        app, this is one form of persistence that you can use. You can use the
        Confluence REST API to get, update, and delete content properties. To
        learn more, see [Content properties in the REST
        API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/content-properties/).


        **CQL:** The Confluence Query Language (CQL) allows you to perform
        complex searches for content using an SQL-like syntax in the `search`
        resource. To learn more, see [Advanced searching using
        CQL](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/advanced-searching-using-cql/).
